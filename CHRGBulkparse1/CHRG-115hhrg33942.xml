    <hearing-info paraId="2" speaker="">The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:31 a.m., in 
room HVC-210, Capitol Visitor Center, Hon. Michael T. McCaul 
(Chairman of the committee) presiding.</hearing-info>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="">    Present: Representatives McCaul, King, Rogers, Barletta, 
Perry, Katko, Hurd, McSally, Fitzpatrick, Estes, Bacon, Lesko, 
Thompson, Jackson Lee, Langevin, Keating, Payne, Vela, Watson 
Coleman, Rice, Correa, Demings, and Barragan.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Committee on Homeland Security will
come to order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The committee is meeting today to examine the work that the 
Department of Homeland Security is doing to assist State and 
local officials to secure election infrastructure, including 
voting machines, vote tallying systems, and voter databases.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman McCaul">In addition to election security, we will also examine 
DHS's role working across all 16 critical infrastructures, 
because a cyber threat to elections may pose a similar threat 
to other critical infrastructure sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I now recognize myself for an opening statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Our democratic system and critical infrastructures are 
under attack. In 2016, Russia meddled in our Presidential 
election through a series of cyber attacks and information 
warfare. Their goals were to undermine the credibility of the 
outcome and sow discord and chaos among the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This was a provocative attack against our country; we must 
not allow it to happen again. I have stated repeatedly and long 
before the last election that foreign interference in our 
democracy cannot be tolerated. I strongly believe we will be 
targeted again this November in the midterm elections, and we 
need to be prepared.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Chairman McCaul">That is why we included $380 million in grants to the 
Election Assistance Commission and $26 million to the 
Department of Homeland Security for election infrastructure in 
fiscal year 2018. These funds will enhance election technology 
and bolster cyber readiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Chairman McCaul">However, malicious use of the internet and the exploitation 
of social media are not just aimed at our election systems. In 
March, the FBI and DHS reported that Russian hackers attacked 
American nuclear power plants. Crippling or shutting down major 
parts of our energy sector would be catastrophic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Russia has already done this to our allies. In 2015, a 
cyber attack turned off electricity for hundreds of thousands 
of Ukrainians. Last year, I stood on the front lines of 
Russia's cyber war in Ukraine and saw the effects first-hand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Nation-state hacking is real and it is dangerous. 
Unfortunately, Russia is not the only villain. Between 2011 and 
2013, Iranian hackers attacked dozens of U.S. banks and tried 
to shut down a dam in New York. In 2014, Chinese hackers stole 
22 million security clearances from OPM, including my own. 
These attacks and others are part of a greater onslaught being 
waged against the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Chairman McCaul">As a result, I have made strengthening our cybersecurity a 
top priority of this committee. In the past year we have passed 
legislation to create the Cyber Security and Infrastructure 
Security Agency to elevate and operationalize the cybersecurity 
mission at DHS; authorize cyber incident response teams to 
assist local and State officials in identifying cyber risks and 
restoring essential services; and reauthorize DHS to ensure it 
offers services to local and State election officials upon 
request.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We are proud of these accomplishments, but we can always do 
more. So today's hearing gives us a chance to offer new ideas 
and promote new solutions to help protect our elections and 
other critical infrastructures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I would like to thank the witnesses for being here today. 
We are grateful for your service to the country and expertise 
and look forward to working with each of you.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> With that, the Chairman now recognizes the
Ranking Member.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to
thank you for holding today's hearing on election security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Mr. Thompson">I, too, would like to congratulate and thank Under 
Secretary Krebs for being here today. Good seeing you. I look 
forward to working with you to make sure DHS legislative 
authorities and responsibilities related to cybersecurity are 
well understood, and to ensure that the Department has the 
resources it needs to carry out the mission effectively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Under Secretary, you have taken the job at a critical 
moment in our Nation. However, I am concerned you do not have 
the support you need from the White House.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. Thompson">You are responsible for building private-sector confidence 
in DHS information-sharing programs like Automated Indicator 
Sharing after President Trump toyed with the idea of planting 
an absurd story to discredit its own--for its own political 
purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. Thompson">You are responsible for securing Federal networks at a time 
when the White House National security advisor has decided to 
eliminate the National Security Council's cybersecurity 
coordinator.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. Thompson">You are responsible for helping secure critical 
infrastructure networks for a White House that would rather 
save jobs in China than heed the advice of intelligence 
community on supply chain vulnerabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. Thompson">And you are responsible for helping State and local 
governments secure election infrastructures following Russia's 
brazen election meddling efforts in 2016, which the President 
has been reluctant to call out and which Congressional 
Republicans, until recently, were content to ignore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Mr. Thompson">As we sit here today, President Trump is in Europe 
complicating your mission. Instead of working with our European 
allies to confront Russia, a shared adversary whose attempts to 
undermine Western Democratic institutions are growing more and 
more bold, he is trolling them to curry favor with Russian 
President Vladimir Putin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. Thompson">President Trump has said he will address Russia's 2016 
election meddling in a meeting with Putin, but he has never 
demonstrated a credible ability to confront Putin in our 
intelligence community's findings. He has predicted his 
meetings with Putin may be the easiest, so I know and I have no 
reason to believe anything productive will come of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. Thompson">This President's failure to take seriously the threat to 
our democracy is one of the main reasons that we must do 
effective and thorough oversight in this body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Although I am pleased that the Majority has finally 
scheduled today's hearing, I am disappointed that the Majority 
failed to invite a full range of stakeholders, including the 
Election Assistance Commission, or hold the hearing at a time 
when DHS's Federal partners were available to participate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. Thompson">It is important to note for the record that committee 
Democrats have been requesting official oversight activities on 
elections security since before the 2016 election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. Thompson">In March 2017, after months of inaction by the Republican 
majority, I introduced a resolution of inquiry seeking 
information from the Department on its activities relating to 
counter--countering Russian election interference in the 2016 
Presidential election, so we would understand how to protect 
our elections in the future. It was unceremoniously rejected 
along party lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Committee Democrats have written to the Chairman no less 
than 5 times since August 2016 to request a hearing, briefing, 
or investigation on vulnerabilities to our election 
infrastructure. We have also reiterated these requests on 
numerous occasions on the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Despite these repeated requests, this committee did not 
conduct a formal hearing or briefing on the topic until April 
2018, 15 months after the intelligence community released its 
report concluding that the Russian government had attempted to 
interfere in the 2016 elections and would attempt to do so 
again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. Thompson">When the Trump administration's 6 top intelligence 
officials testified before the Senate that Russia was targeting 
2018 elections, this committee, the committee that prides 
itself on acting in the wake of current issues, followed suit 
of the House Republican conference by shirking its 
responsibility to act on this urgent threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Ranking Members of the Oversight and Government Reform 
Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, Judiciary Committee, 
the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Armed 
Services, and the House Administration Committee have all urged 
the Chairs or Speaker Ryan to aggressively address this on-
going National threat. Our calls for action were ignored, 
responded to with a halfhearted acknowledgment of the threat 
and a vague promise for future action, or the offer to ask a 
Government witness about election security at a hearing on 
another topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Because of--our request for thorough hearings and briefings 
were denied, some committee Democrats joined the Democrats on 
the Committee of House Administration to form the Congressional 
Task Force on Election Security. I openly asked Republicans to 
join us and submit their ideas, yet no Republican Member 
provided their input or attended the task force's public 
events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. Thompson">After studying the topics for 8 months, meeting with 
stakeholders and holding a series of forums and briefings, the 
task force produced a report and introduced legislation to 
implement the recommendations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Mr. Chairman, I have a stack of requests made by Democrats 
for action on election security, a copy of the report on 
legislation I referenced, and other election security oversight 
documents, and I ask that they be entered into record at this 
time.

The Honorable James R. Clapper,
Director of National Intelligence, Office of the Director of National</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Intelligence, Washington, DC 20511.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Director Corney, Secretaries Kerry and Carter, and General 
Clapper: As senior Members of national security committees in Congress, 
we are deeply troubled by reports of a Russia-supported hacking of 
Democratic National Committee data, and we applaud the FBI's quick 
action launching an investigation. We request that the Administration 
brief Members of Congress on this situation as soon as possible in 
unclassified or classified settings as needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We see two separate issues at play here, both of which deserve the 
focus of investigators and congressional overseers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Chairman McCaul">First, the DNC hack was plainly cyber crime. More and more, 
America's adversaries are employing cyber theft and cyber terrorism as 
tactics to threaten our security. We need to understand fully the 
extent of the hack and work to determine who was responsible. We need 
to assess whose personal information was compromised by the attack and 
ensure those individuals have what they need to prevent any further 
damage. We need to determine what vulnerabilities allowed this attack 
to succeed, and provide information to the public about how to guard 
against future attacks of this nature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Second--and perhaps more important--the timing and content of the 
theft, targeting one of our two major political parties, makes clear 
that this cyber attack amounts to more than a public embarrassment or 
harmless mischief. If reports of Russia's involvement are confirmed, 
the only reasonable conclusion is that leaders in Russia are stealing 
and disseminating information in an effort to sway an election in the 
United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This is an action right out of President Putin's playbook. In 
recent years, Russia has influenced elections, infiltrated political 
parties across Europe, and stoked divisive politics in the hope of 
fracturing Western unity. It doesn't stretch the imagination that Mr. 
Putin would now try his hand at manipulating the course of American 
democracy--leaking information through a syndicate that has repeated 
anti-Semitic insinuations, endangered lives, and threatened American 
security by recklessly releasing stolen information. That scenario 
should sound the alarm for people across this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Chairman McCaul">That's why we also ask that the FBI collaborate with the 
Departments of State and Defense and the Intelligence Community to 
obtain a complete picture of Russia's involvement and its leaders 
intentions. Nearly a half century ago, a break-in at the DNC 
headquarters eventually led to the end of a Presidency. For a foreign 
government to engage in the same sort of behavior cannot be tolerated. 
Russia doesn't get to put its thumb on the scale in our elections. In 
the days ahead, we need to send a clear message to Russia's leaders and 
all who mean us harm: we will not allow the Kremlin or any other 
foreign power to dictate the terms of political debate in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Chairman McCaul">With the clock ticking down to our election, we ask for quick 
action on this matter. The American people deserve to go to the polls 
in November confident that Russian subterfuge has had no role in 
setting the agenda for our country's future.</paragraph>

the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating whether 
Russia executed cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee

``Donald Trump's campaign chairman helped a pro-Russian governing party

U.S. policy. . . .Under Federal law, U.S. lobbyists must declare 
publicly if they represent foreign leaders or their political parties

Department. A violation is a felony and can result in up to 5 years in 
prison and a fine of up to $250,000.''\20\

request that the committee convene a joint briefing with the Select 
Committee on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and House Administration to 
discuss specific threats to the U.S. election systems from outside 
influences. It has been reported that attempts have already been made 
to compromise the integrity of State-wide voter registration databases

accessing information on registered voters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Chairman McCaul">For these reasons, I believe that it is important that a joint

President Barack Obama,

to our allies, our alliances and to democratic institutions around the 
world.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The integrity of democracy must never be in question, and we are

WikiLeaks and other venues, and the production and distribution of fake 
news stories.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Foreign interference presents a win-win for Russia--which we must 
counter. By eroding Americans' and foreigners' trust in U.S. 
institutions, Russia both weakens our country and sows global 
instability and uncertainty. Both present a boon for Russia and a loss 
for those working to maintain peace and prosperity around the world 
through the leadership of the United States and its allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Chairman McCaul">To evaluate Congress's response appropriately, we would like all 
Members to have a comprehensive understanding of what the U.S. 
intelligence community knows regarding Russia's involvement in these 
actions and attempts to interfere in our election. Specifically, we are 
requesting a classified briefing that will provide details regarding 
Russian entities' hacking of American political organizations; hacking 
and strategic release of emails from campaign officials; the WikiLeaks

to mislead American voters; and any other Russian or Russian-related

    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Chairman McCaul">December 13, 2016.
The Honorable Michael McCaul,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 176 Ford HOB, Washington, DC</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Chairman McCaul">20515.
The Honorable Bennie Thompson,
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, H2-117 Ford HOB,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Washington, DC 20515.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: As a Member of 
the standing Committee on Homeland Security since its creation, I am 
writing to respectfully request that the committee conduct thorough and 
probing hearings regarding the activities of entities allied with the 
Government of Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential 
election in the United States when the 115th Congress convenes in 
January 2017.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Given your strong commitment to the rule of law and constitutional 
governance, and your demonstrated record of working together 
constructively, I know you find it as deeply disturbing as I do that 
the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded, in a secret assessment, 
that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win 
the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. 
electoral system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This is as grave an attack on American independence and sovereignty 
as Pearl Harbor and 9/11. It cannot be allowed to stand with impunity. 
The facts and actors involved in this plot must be uncovered and laid 
bare for the American people to see and understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which includes 
the Central Intelligence Agency, has cited a growing body of 
intelligence from multiple sources confirming that the politically 
motivated hacks of the 2016 election originated at the highest levels 
of the Kremlin and confirmed that the activity was intended to favor 
Presidential candidate Trump. This election malfeasance on the part of 
the Government of Russia appears to be part of wider strategy to 
disrupt and destabilize the political system and economies ofthe 
western democracies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The integrity of the democratic process must never be in question, 
and I am very concerned that Russian interference in the recent 
election may have inflicted substantial damage to Americans' confidence 
in the political system. That interference includes, but is not limited 
to sponsoring disclosures through WikiLeaks and other venues, the 
production and distribution of fake news stories to influence 
traditional and social media, and cyber attacks on computing networks 
used by local and State election administrations and political 
organizations to communicate with voters, constituents, and other 
members of the public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Foreign interference in U.S. elections also represents a serious 
threat to National security to the full enjoyment and exercise ofthe 
civil liberties and rights Americans justly value and cherish. There 
can be no higher priority for the next Congress than ensuring that the 
election process, the hallmark of this democratic republic's 
governance, is invulnerable to foreign influence or manipulation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Specifically, the House Homeland Security Committee should 
investigate the findings of the intelligence community thorough a 
comprehensive, or ``deep-dive,'' investigation of the cyber attacks 
that plagued the 2016 Presidential election, including cyber attacks 
previously designed to undermine the campaign of the Democratic 
Presidential candidate which were previously determined by the U.S. 
intelligence community to be connected to entities allied with the 
Government of Russia. Further, the hearings should explore the impact, 
if any, that media reporting of WikiLeaks data breach information had 
on voter decisions in the 2016 election and the influence of ``fake 
news,'' false stories deliberately injected into the news mainstream to 
mislead and misinform voters, such as the Comet Ping Pong incident 
which led a North Carolina man to fire rounds from an AR-15 rifle into 
a crowd at a pizzeria in Washington, DC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The linchpin of representative democracies such as the United 
States is public confidence in the political system, regime, and 
community. That confidence in turn rests upon the extent to which the 
public has faith that the system employed to select its leaders 
accurately reflects its preferences. At bottom, this means that the 
American people must be able to freely elect their leaders without 
interference, covert or overt, from foreign governments or entities 
allied with foreign powers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Chairman McCaul">For these reasons, it is essential that when the 115th Congress 
convenes in January 2017, the Committee on the Homeland Security 
conduct thorough and probing inquiry regarding the activities of 
entities allied with the Government of Russia to influence the outcome 
of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Thank you for your consideration of this urgent request. If you 
have questions or need further information, contact me through my Chief 
of Staff, Glenn Rushing.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Chairman McCaul">May 23, 2017.
President Donald J. Trump,
The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Mr. President: Last week, reports surfaced that the White 
House may be planning to create a false narrative about the Department 
of Homeland Security's Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) program in 
order to neutralize criticism over your handling of classified 
information with Russian officials.\1\ 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Chairman McCaul">\1\ Foreign Policy, ``Trump Team Planning Possible Retaliation for 
Classified Leak Allegation,'' by Jenna McLaughlin (May 18, 2017), 
http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/18/trump-team-planning-possible-
retaliation-for-classified-leak-allegations/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Chairman McCaul">According to a piece in Foreign Policy (FP), White House officials 
met last Wednesday to discuss the possibility of planting a story in 
the media or opening an investigation to accuse DHS of using the AIS 
platform to ``inappropriately open up streams of sensitive data to 
Russia and other nonallies.''\2\ These officials hoped to create the 
illusion that AIS, a public-facing portal that does not deal in 
classified information, exhibits careless information practices by the 
Obama administration roughly equivalent to your disclosure of 
intelligence gathered by a foreign ally. A second source confirmed that 
``Trump and his team have been interested in targeting the Homeland 
Security program for the past couple weeks. Nothing has been decided . 
. . but it's an option on the table.''\3\

    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Chairman McCaul">\3\ Id. (quoting the article, not the source).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Chairman McCaul">These reports, if true, are deeply troubling. The AIS program is 
the result of bipartisan legislation enacted in the 114th Congress, 
after years of negotiation between privacy, security, and industry 
stakeholders in an effort to speed public-private sharing of cyber 
threat indicators. In a press release celebrating AIS' launch last 
year, DHS described the capability as ``the `See Something, Say 
Something' of the internet,'' noting that:
``When one participant detects a threat, all participants in AIS will 
learn about it. By broadening the depth and increasing the speed of 
cybersecurity information sharing, the country as a whole will be 
better able to manage cyber threats. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015 also 
provides targeted liability protection to companies that share cyber 
threat indicators with DHS or with each other. And like all of the 
Department's cybersecurity programs, AIS includes rigorous privacy and 
civil liberties protections.''\4\

    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Despite holding enormous promise, AIS is still in its nascent 
stages. The Department should be using its limited resources to grow 
the capability and build trusted partnerships with its customer base, 
rather than fighting off baseless accusations. While we sincerely hope 
that the accounts in the FP report are not true, we nevertheless cannot 
stand aside and allow the White House to jeopardize this important 
program in a self-serving attempt to change the news cycle.</paragraph>

The Honorable Michael T. McCaul,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, H2-176 Ford House Office</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Building, Washington, DC 20515.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Chairman McCaul: I am writing to express my continued 
commitment to examining the Russian government's interference in the 
2016 elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Chairman McCaul">On April 5, during the consideration of a measure to jumpstart an 
investigation into what the Department of Homeland Security knew and 
did about this unprecedented attack on our democracy (H. Res. 235), you 
indicated that, while you opposed my resolution of inquiry, you 
supported examining this issue through the normal committee process. At 
the time, you suggested that Members could ask DHS Secretary Kelly 
about Russian interference when he testifies next before the committee. 
While asking one-off questions of the Secretary at a public hearing of 
Government officials in a closed-door meeting here or overseas may 
yield some information, it does not replace the need for a 
comprehensive investigation. The gravity of this matter demands more; 
it demands that the committee launch a bipartisan investigation--
particularly given recent developments surrounding the Russia 
investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Following President Trump's abrupt firing of FBI Director Comey 
earlier this month, a special counsel was appointed by the Deputy 
Attorney General to oversee the investigation, which FBI Director Comey 
initiated, into Russian meddling in our elections. Since then, the 
drumbeat for an independent commission that cannot be interfered with 
by the Trump administration steadily intensified. As I said during my 
opening statement when H. Res. 235 was considered, current 
investigations under way in Congress and at the Justice Department are 
not likely to focus on DHS's efforts--which are important to evaluate 
given that the Russians are expected to attempt to interfere in future 
U.S. elections. As such, now is the time for this committee to launch 
its own bipartisan inquiry.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I share the view that you expressed at our April markup that any 
foreign government interference in our elections is unacceptable and 
should not go unpunished. By launching a committee investigation, we 
could do our part to ensure not only that those involved are punished 
but that State officials responsible for overseeing our elections have 
the answers they need to guard against future interference. Protecting 
our election systems has been and will continue to be a bipartisan 
issue. I truly hope that we can begin to address this matter with the 
seriousness that it deserves, and look forward to working with you to 
undertake oversight into DHS's efforts to identify and mitigate harm to 
our election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. If you have 
any questions, please contact Rosaline Cohen, Chief Counsel for 
Legislation.</paragraph>

``In light ofthe mounting evidence that Russia sought to interfere with

the new administration would continue to prioritize cybersecurity 
assistance to State and local election officials. Accordingly, when you 
first testified before our Committee on February 7, 2017, you were 
asked about your views on the critical infrastructure subsector 
designation. You assuaged our concern that the administration might 
rescind the designation when you responded: `I believe we should help 
all of the [S]tates--provide them as much help as we can to make sure 
that their systems are protected in future elections. So, I would argue

    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Chairman McCaul">November 16, 2017.
The Honorable Rodney P. Frelinghuysen,
Chairman, Committee on Apprpriations.
The Honorable Nita M. Lowey,
Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Lowey: As you and 
your colleagues prepare to finalize appropriations legislation for 
fiscal year 2018, we respectfully request that you appropriate the 
remaining $400 million from the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) 
for States to use to secure their elections infrastructure.\1\ We know 
now that Russia launched an unprecedented assault on our elections in 
2016, targeting 21 States' voting systems, and we believe this money is 
necessary to protect our elections from future attack.

    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Over the past 5 months, we have co-chaired an Election Security 
Task Force to better understand what can be done to protect our 
elections going forward. Our findings demonstrate that there is an 
urgent need for Federal funding to help States secure their elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Through our investigation, we found that voting machines can easily 
be hacked. In July, at DefCon, one of the world's largest, longest-
running, and best-known hacker conferences, 25 pieces of election 
equipment were successfully breached by participants with little prior 
knowledge and limited tools.\2\ In over 40 States, elections are 
carried out using voting machines that were purchased more than a 
decade ago.\3\ These machines are now either obsolete or at the end of 
their useful life. Some of these machines rely on operating systems 
like Windows XP or Windows 2000 which pose a particularly significant 
security risk as those operating systems either do not receive regular 
security patches, or have stopped receiving support altogether.\4\ 
These issues are exacerbated by the fact that 20 percent of Americans 
cast their ballot on voting machines that do not have any kind of paper 
backup.\5\ In other words, if these paperless machines were hacked, it 
would be nearly impossible to tell.\6\

    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Chairman McCaul">State voter registration databases are also vulnerable to attack. 
In Illinois, hackers successfully breached registration databases and 
attempted, but failed, to alter and delete voting records.\7\ In 
Arizona, hackers successfully installed malware on a county election 
official's computer.\8\ Russian hackers also targeted at least one 
election vendor with the hope of ultimately obtaining access into 
numerous State and local voter registration databases.\9\ If these 
attacks had been successful, hackers would have been able to alter or 
delete voter registration records, causing a great deal of chaos on 
Election Day and potentially swaying the results of the election.

    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The single most urgent need is for States using paperless machines 
to replace their outdated equipment with paper ballot voting systems. 
The Brennan Center estimates that cost to replace paperless voting 
machines would be between $130 and S400 million, and States do not have 
the money to do this themselves.\10\ South Carolina is 1 of the 5 
remaining States that relies exclusively on paperless machines, and a 
spokesman for the South Carolina Election Commission recently told the 
New York Times, ``We're using the same equipment we've used since 2004. 
If $40 million dropped into our hands today, we'd have a paper ballot 
trail, too.''\11\ In order to prevent future attacks, States also need 
to hire IT staff to upgrade and maintain IT infrastructure, and train 
election officials and poll workers on cybersecurity.

    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Chairman McCaul">State and local election officials are acutely aware that they need 
to improve election security, but they lack the necessary funds to 
safeguard their voting infrastructure.\12\ In most States, legislatures 
are not increasing their election security budgets.\13\ In some cases, 
Governors are actively undermining election security efforts. In 
Florida, Governor Scott's budget proposed reducing the funding for the 
Division of Elections by almost $1 million.\14\ In July, Governor 
Kasich vetoed a provision in Ohio's budget that would have allocated $1 
million toward voting equipment.\15\ Governor Walker issued a partial 
veto to the State's budget, and in doing so, eliminated five jobs from 
the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\16\ This issue is simply too 
important to sit back and watch State governments and the Federal 
Government pass responsibility back and forth.

    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Moreover, State and local officials have expressed a desire for 
Congress to step in. In a recent Politico survey of State election 
officials, 21 of 33 respondents want the Federal Government to 
authorize funds for States to spend on replacing voting machines or 
otherwise strengthening election security.\17\ In response to the 
letter sent out by the Task Force to the chief election official in 
each State asking how the Federal Government could help States with 
election security, the National Association of Secretaries of States 
replied by saying, `'States would clearly benefit from the 
appropriation of the outstanding balance of Federal HAVA funds to aid 
them in ensuring that they have sufficient equipment, technical 
support, and resources to maintain a sound security posture for their 
computer-based systems.''\18\

dangers aren't surprising. But lawmakers and election officials' 
lackadaisical response is both staggering and distressing . . . This is 
a matter of National security, and Congress should treat it as such.''

    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Letter From Six Members of Congress</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Chairman McCaul">January 9, 2018.
The Honorable Paul D. Ryan,
Speaker of the House of Representatives, United States Capitol,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Washington, DC 20515.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Mr. Speaker: January 6 marked 1 year since the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence released its ominous report 
documenting Russia's multifaceted campaign to interfere in the 2016 
elections and warning that Russia is likely to do it again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Over the past year, our Nation has learned more about the breadth 
and magnitude of Russia's growing threat against our democracy and our 
National security. We now know that Russia used its influence to help 
elect Donald Trump, sought to interfere in at least 21 State elections, 
executed a propaganda campaign to manipulate and sow discord among the 
American people, and hacked our Nation's critical infrastructure, 
including U.S. electricity grids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Since then, President Trump's former National Security Adviser, 
Michael Flynn, and the President's former campaign policy adviser, 
George Papadopoulos, both have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about 
their contacts with Russia. President Trump also fired James Comey, the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, because he continued 
to investigate the ``Russia thing'' while refusing to pledge his 
loyalty to President Trump.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Russia's aggression toward the United States and the Trump 
administration's efforts to cover up its communications with the 
Russians demand an immediate, whole-of-Government response. Yet, 
Republican House leaders and Committee Chairmen have blocked, 
stonewalled, and rejected our basic requests to investigate, hold 
public hearings, and advance legislation to address these matters. 
House Republicans have chosen to put President Trump ahead of our 
National interests.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Rather than pursue the truth on behalf of the American people, 
House Republicans have waged an aggressive campaign to shut down 
Congressional and criminal investigations into Russia's attack, they 
have launched and re-launched investigations into baseless conspiracy 
theories to deflect attention and resources, they have defamed our 
Nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and they have 
sought to discredit anyone seeking to uncover wrongdoing, including 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a decorated war veteran.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Chairman McCaul">To date, the House has held only one full committee public hearing 
on the most significant finding of the ODNI report: That our elections 
continue to be vulnerable to foreign interference in the future. 
Instead, they have relegated this issue to a handful of toothless 
subcommittee hearings, which have been marked by the Trump 
administration's refusal to provide documents requested by Democrats 
that would help inform our work, such as documents relating to Russia's 
attempted attacks against 21 State election systems that are currently 
being withheld by the Department of Homeland Security. Our country, our 
democracy, and the American public deserve better.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Chairman McCaul">As Members of Congress, we take a solemn oath to support and defend 
the Constitution and protect the American people. The failure of House 
Republicans to take strong and swift action in the face of Russia's 
assault on our democracy is beneath the dignity of this oath. The 
strength and integrity of our democracy, the rule of law, and our 
democratic institutions hang in the balance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We ask you to change course and begin demonstrating true leadership 
on this critical National security issue. We request that House 
Republicans join us in fulfilling our sworn Constitutional duty by 
ensuring that each committee of jurisdiction thoroughly investigates 
the following key questions:
  &lt;bullet&gt; How were Russian hackers able to penetrate our State</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Chairman McCaul">election systems, and how do we protect our elections</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Chairman McCaul">infrastructure in advance of upcoming elections this year and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Chairman McCaul">beyond?
  &lt;bullet&gt; What vulnerabilities remain in our electrical grids and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Chairman McCaul">infrastructure networks, and what can we be doing to ensure our</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Chairman McCaul">safety and security?
  &lt;bullet&gt; How was social media leveraged to influence voters, and what</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Chairman McCaul">can be done to ensure that American voters know where their</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Chairman McCaul">information is coming from?
  &lt;bullet&gt; What was the extent of the Trump campaign's involvement in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Russia's operation to hack and disseminate material damaging to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Hillary Clinton?
  &lt;bullet&gt; In light of President Trump's refusal to release his tax</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Chairman McCaul">returns, what is the extent of his and his family's business</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Chairman McCaul">and financial ties to Russians, and how might those ties</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Chairman McCaul">constitute leverage over the President and his family?
  &lt;bullet&gt; In light of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' testimony in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Chairman McCaul">October that the Trump administration is not doing enough to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Chairman McCaul">stop future Russian interference and that ``the matter is so</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Chairman McCaul">complex that for most of us we are not able to fully grasp the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Chairman McCaul">technical dangers that are out there,'' what steps has the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Trump administration taken to hold Russia accountable for its</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Chairman McCaul">attack and ensure the safety of our elections from foreign</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Chairman McCaul">interference?
  &lt;bullet&gt; Why is the Trump administration dragging its feet on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Chairman McCaul">implementing the sanctions against Russia that were adopted by</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Congress with widespread bipartisan support?
  &lt;bullet&gt; What are the extent and nature of efforts by the Trump</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Chairman McCaul">administration to impede criminal and Congressional</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Chairman McCaul">investigations into the Trump campaign's involvement and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Chairman McCaul">support for Russian interference into our elections?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We are extremely concerned by the intelligence community's warning 
that Russia may attempt to interfere with future elections--including 
the upcoming mid-term elections--and we are deeply troubled by the lack 
of action by the Trump administration and House Republicans in 
responding to this core threat to our democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We ask you to review this request and to schedule a meeting with 
leaders of both parties so we may work together to respond to the 
matters of serious concern raised in this letter. Thank you for your 
consideration of these requests.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Chairman McCaul">February 16, 2018.
Chairman Michael T. McCaul,
Committee on Homeland Security, H2-l76 Ford House Office Building,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Washington, DC 20515.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Chairman McCaul: I am writing to express my continued concern 
about election security and Russian interference in our election 
systems. I ask that you to take urgent action by holding a hearing on 
this important homeland security issue and marking up recently-
introduced legislation to protect our election systems, H.R. 5011, the 
Election Security Act. Both actions should be taken without delay as 
the first election of the 2018 season will take place in your home 
State of Texas on March 6, 2018.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Chairman McCaul">In November 2016, 139 million Americans cast their votes in the 
wake of a massive Russian cyber-enabled influence operation designed to 
undermine faith in American democracy, exposing serious National 
security vulnerabilities in our election infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Chairman McCaul">In response, on January 6, 2017, then-Secretary of Homeland 
Security Jeh Johnson designated election infrastructure as a critical 
infrastructure subsector, citing its importance to our National 
interests. The same day, the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence (ODNI) released a declassified report entitled 
``Background to Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent 
US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution'' 
that concluded the Kremlin would use lessons from its 2016 elections 
operations to influence future elections world-wide. Similarly, in 
March 2017, dudng a hearing before the House Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence, then-Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director 
James Comey warned that Russia would use its experience from the 2016 
elections to attempt to influence upcoming U.S. elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Recognizing the alarming conclusions of our National security and 
intelligence agencies and on-going reports of our foreign adversaries' 
intentions, on May 23, 2017, I wrote to you to request a Committee on 
Homeland Security investigation into Russian interference in our 
elections. While this committee failed to take action, Government 
officials continued to sound the alarm. At the Aspen Security Forum in 
July 2017, the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, the former Secretary of Homeland Security, 
and the White House's Homeland Security Advisor all agreed that Russian 
entities targeted the 2016 elections. Additionally, in July 2017, a 
Department of Homeland Security official testified before the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence that State election systems were 
targeted by nefarious Russian actors. Even after it came to light that 
almost half of U.S. States had been targeted by the Russians, including 
States Members of the Committee on Homeland Security call home, our 
committee did not have a single noticed activity on the issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Absent action on my request, on June 29, 2017, I joined with 
colleagues from the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on 
House Administration to form the Congressional Task Force on Election 
Security. Earlier this week, after months of engagement with State 
election officials, security experts, and other stakeholders, the Task 
Force released a comprehensive report with findings and recommendations 
and unveiled the Election Security Act, which is aimed at bolstering 
protections for upcoming U.S. elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Task Force's report comes on the heels of still more warnings 
from U.S. Government officials that Russia seeks to interfere with our 
upcoming elections. Indeed, a week prior to the release of our report, 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that Russia is already trying 
to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections. On February 13, the day 
prior to the release of the Task Force's final report, 6 current 
intelligence officials--the Director of National Intelligence, the 
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of the FBI, 
the Director of the National Security Agency, the Director of the 
Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Director of the National 
Geospatial Intelligence Agency--unanimously agreed that the 2018 
elections are a potential target for Russian operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Given the seriousness of this threat to our Nation, Congress must 
redouble its efforts to thwart foreign influences seeking to interfere 
in our elections. The Committee on Homeland Security should have acted 
long ago. With less than 10 legislative days prior to the first primary 
election of the year, it is critical that we hold a hearing to examine 
this National security issue and consider the Election Security Act 
without delay. We owe it to the American public to act. I look forward 
to working with you to secure our Nation's elections and our democracy.</paragraph>

Ranking Member Bennie Thompson,
Committee on Homeland Security, H2-117 Ford House Office Building,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Washington, DC 20515.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Ranking Member Thompson: Thank you for your February 16, 2018 
letter. Russian interference in our electoral process and the 
undermining of our democratic institutions by a foreign adversary must 
never be tolerated. That is why I am proud of our bipartisan efforts to 
pass the first ever, comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS). Specifically, I am glad we adopted an 
amendment that prioritizes and requires DHS to provide voluntary 
assistance to State and local election officials in recognition of the 
importance of election infrastructure. Not only did we pass this bill 
unanimously through our committee, it passed through the House with 
overwhelming bipartisan support last July by a vote of 386-41.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Chairman McCaul">It is imperative that we continue to ensure DHS has the most 
efficient and robust structure possible to help thwart all cyber 
adversaries. The bipartisan Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency Act of 2017, which I introduced and you co-sponsored, elevates 
and operationalizes the Department's cybersecurity and infrastructure

is so integral to our shared concerns. This bill also sailed through 
the House with support from both parties. The Senate should follow our 
lead and get these bills to the President's desk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Chairman McCaul">While recognizing Russian interference in our election in October 
of 2016, I called on President Obama to ``send a clear signal to 
Moscow: attempts to influence U.S. elections or interfere with our 
democratic system will be met with severe consequences.'' Since that 
time, I have remained consistent on the seriousness of this threat. 
Just last week, I called for the extradition of Russians who had been 
indicted for election interference, so they could be ``held accountable 
and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'' Clearly, these kinds 
of attacks transcend partisan politics.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I want to encourage all Members of the committee to raise this 
vital issue when Secretary Nielsen appears before the committee during 
our March budget hearing. In addition, it is my goal to have the Under

    <paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Chairman Frelinghuysen, Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Lowey, 
and Ranking Member Quigley: We write to express strong support for the 
Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and to respectfully request that 
the EAC receive $14 million so it can continue to assist States in 
their urgent efforts to secure voting systems in advance of the 2018 
midterm elections. In addition, we request that you appropriate $400 
million under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) for States to 
use to replace aging and vulnerable voting machines and to provide 
cybersecurity training.\1\ Intelligence officials continue to warn that 
our State-based electoral system is a target for foreign meddling and 
cyber attacking, and we believe this money is necessary to protect 
American elections against the possibility of imminent attack.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The EAC is the only Federal agency charged with making American 
elections more secure, accessible, accurate, and transparent. It has 
built strong relationships with State and local election officials as 
well as cybersecurity experts, and has been vital to helping States 
understand and respond to the threats confronting their election 
infrastructure. The EAC has worked diligently, with a bare-bones 
budget, over the past few years to provide guidance on cybersecurity 
and election technology. But at this critical time, the Commission 
needs additional resources to fully respond to the needs of the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Providing the EAC with additional funds would enable them to hire 
two additional staffers whose exclusive responsibilities would be to 
work directly with State and local election officials, as well as 
cybersecurity experts, on improving cybersecurity. In addition, the 
agency could hire two additional researchers to develop best practices 
on cybersecurity and risk-limiting audits, and to create materials to 
train election officials and poll workers on security issues. The EAC 
would also be able to hold a summit to bring together computer 
scientists, ``white hat'' hackers, and academics to examine election 
technologies and expose any vulnerabilities before the equipment is put 
to use. Finally, the EAC could increase the amount of funds it 
transfers to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
to $2.5 million which would enable NIST to provide further technical 
expertise on voting machine standards.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Furthermore, States need an additional $400 million in grants under 
HAVA to be appropriated so they can safeguard their voting 
infrastructure. The single most urgent need is for States using 
paperless machines to replace their outdated equipment with paper 
ballot voting systems. The Brennan Center estimates that the cost to 
replace paperless voting machines is between $130 and $400 million, and 
States do not have the money to do it themselves.\3\ Moreover, State 
and local officials have expressed a desire for Congress to step in. ln 
December 2017, the National Association of Secretaries of States (NASS) 
called upon Congress to provide the States with the remaining HAVA 
funds. President of NASS and Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson 
said, ``The challenges faced by State and local election officials in 
2017 are quite different from those we faced in 2002.''\4\

    <paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Chairman McCaul">\4\ National Association of Secretaries of States. (December 15,

Outstanding HAVA Funds. [Press release].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Appropriating a new round of HAVA grants would not address all 
security concerns. As you may know, the Congressional Task Force on 
Election Security found that States need funding to hire IT staff, 
upgrade and maintain IT infrastructure, implement risk limiting audits, 
develop more secure election technology, and for cybersecurity 
training. Toward that end, its legislative proposal requests a total of 
$1.8 billion--half of the amount initially authorized to fight hanging 
chads in HAVA--over 10 years to replace all non-secure voting machines, 
maintain and upgrade elections systems, provide on-going cybersecurity 
training, help States implement risk limiting audits, and invest in 
innovative election technology. But the $400 million already authorized 
would allow States to address their biggest vulnerability by replacing 
paperless voting machines and would represent an important down payment 
on tackling this long-term National security challenge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We cannot leave States to their own devices in defending against 
the sophisticated cyber tactics of foreign governments. An attack on 
the electoral infrastructure in one State is an attack on all of 
democracy in America. Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland 
Security, and Grover Norquist wrote in The Washington Post, ``It's not 
practical to expect local election administrators in rural Missouri or 
small-town Maine to go toe-to-toe with the premier government-backed 
cyber mercenaries in China or North Korea. Just as Federal agencies 
prudently provide support for State law enforcement in dealing with 
terrorism, Federal officials should give guidance and support in 
dealing with the election cybersecurity threat.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We urge you to fully fund HAVA and provide the EAC with the support 
it needs so that the Federal Government can meaningfully assist States

    <paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Chairman McCaul">March 12, 2018.
The Honorable Michael T. McCaul,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20515.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Dear Mr. Chairman: I am pleased that on Wednesday, March 7, you 
publicly announced that the committee would commence efforts to address 
two homeland security issues--election security and school security. On 
the subject of election security, I was pleased to hear you express 
that you share concerns that I, along with my Democratic colleagues on 
the committee, have repeatedly expressed about the prospect that 
Vladimir Putin's cyber hackers continue to pose a threat to our 
election infrastructure and that the 2018 elections are a target. 
Further, you informed the committee that on March 6 you sent a request 
for a Classified briefing from the Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) on the cybersecurity threats facing State election systems. I 
request that this Classified briefing be an official noticed activity. 
You also indicated that you intend to notice a public hearing dedicated 
to receiving testimony on election security from Federal Government 
witnesses as soon as possible. There are just 8 legislative days left 
until the next Congressional work period. As such, I would appreciate 
information on the projected time line for holding both the election 
security briefing and hearing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Chairman McCaul">With respect to school security, I was heartened to hear you 
acknowledge that school security is a homeland security issue. I was 
also pleased to hear you express interest to move forward, on a 
bipartisan basis, with school security legislation in this committee. 
However, I am disappointed that consideration of H.R. 4627, the 
``Shielding Public Spaces from Vehicular Terrorism Act'' was postponed. 
As such, a timely amendment Rep. Val Demings (D-FL) authored, 
addressing the risk that President Trump could direct DHS to abandon a 
long-standing prohibition on Federal homeland security grant 
expenditures on guns to allow such purchases for teachers, did not get 
considered. While I was pleased to hear you acknowledge that this 
prohibition is a long-standing DHS policy, I was perplexed to learn 
that the Majority needs more time to seek more infmmation to ``properly 
vet'' the amendment, given that no outreach was made to Rep. Demings or 
my staff since Monday, March 5 at 10 a.m., when the amendment was filed 
as required under the committee notice. Action on the Demings 
legislation is necessary, given that the President recently expressed 
support for Federal funding to be provided to cover firearms training 
for K-12 educators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We would welcome the opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis to 
make our Nation's schools more secure to terrorism, active shootings, 
and other threats, as you expressed was your goal. We stand ready to 
work with you on such legislation, and we would appreciate greater 
detail when you expect to take up H.R. 4627 with concern to your goals, 
timing-wise, for bipartisan school security legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Further, I believe the bipartisan school security legislative 
effort could be bolstered by the committee holding a hearing outside of 
the Capitol. To that end, I would highlight that on March 6, Emergency 
Preparedness, Response, and Communications (EPRC) Ranking Member, 
Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-NJ), submitted a request for a field hearing to 
conduct oversight on DHS's effort to improve school security and 
preparedness in his New Jersey Congressional district. As you know, 
Ranking Member Payne's interest in this homeland security issue dates 
back to 2013, when he introduced the ``SAFE in Our Schools Act'' (H.R. 
3158).</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Election security and school security demand urgent action. 
Accordingly, I look forward to getting a more detailed picture of your 
specific plans for committee action on these homeland security 
challenges, as sought above. Together, I believe we can, in a 
bipartisan way, make our children, constituents, communities, and this 
democracy more secure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Chairman McCaul">To coordinate such effort, please do not hesitate to have your 
staff contact my staff director, Hope Goins.</paragraph>

considered immediately.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The diverse nature of the cyber threat, and the recent revelation 
that outside actors, possibly nation-states, have an increased interest 
in influencing our elections, make it imperative that the Federal 
Government give additional attention to securing our electoral system 
and possibly deem it part of our Nation's critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Without delay, Mr. Johnson should communicate with the thousands of 
jurisdictions in the country that help carry out elections and offer 
the Department of Homeland Security's assistance, expertise, and 
guidance. While the diverse and varied nature of our voting 
infrastructure confounds efforts to secure it, this tells us that the 
process should begin as soon as possible.</paragraph>

following joint statement in response to news reports about 
intelligence assessments of Russian interference in the 2016 election, 
and comments by the House Republican leadership downplaying the need 
for a thorough investigation:
``All Americans should be deeply concerned by the reports that Russian 
agencies have interfered with a U.S. election. As Speaker Ryan noted, 
`any foreign intervention in our elections is entirely unacceptable.'
``The first duty of the United States Government is to safeguard the 
American people and the integrity of our free society from attacks by 
foreign adversaries. Cyber attacks on our political institutions are 
direct threats to their integrity and are just as menacing as attacks 
on our economic, physical, and military infrastructure.
``Given the gravity of these unprecedented attacks by a foreign state, 
we need a Congressional investigation that is truly bipartisan, that is 
comprehensive, that will not be restricted by jurisdictional lines, and 
that will give the American people a complete and full accounting of 
what happened consistent with safeguarding our National security.''</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Feb. 8, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--Yesterday, the Committee on House Administration 
voted on party lines to eliminate the independent Election Assistance 
Commission. The EAC was created to help States upgrade voting 
technology and promote critical election-related information sharing. 
Having up-to-date voting machine technology is critical to ensure they 
are protected from any potential hacking, tampering, or fraud.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This inexplicable move willfully ignores the present-day threats to 
election infrastructure. In fact, yesterday, Homeland Security 
Secretary John Kelly stated to Congress: ``I believe we should help all 
of the States, provide them as much help as we can to make sure their 
systems are protected in future elections'' [VIDEO of exchange with 
Rep. Cedric Richmond]. He also noted that protecting the Nation's 
electoral systems should be a priority under the National 
Infrastructure Protection Plan. Additionally, President Trump has said 
that our election systems were compromised in the 2016 election and 
millions illegitimately voted. Those allegations are reported to be 
investigated by the White House under a commission that lacks the 
independence of the EAC.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking Member of the Homeland 
Security Committee, released the following statement on the change:
``The danger of cyber attacks from state and non-state actors is 
constantly escalating and evolving and Americans must be confident that 
we are addressing this threat. Congress cannot abdicate this 
responsibility while the President sends Federal investigators on a 
wild goose chase to search for millions and millions of non-existent 
illegal votes. Given public unease regarding Russia's extensive 
interference with the recent Presidential election, Congress should be 
doing more, not less, to ensure the integrity of our electoral systems. 
Our legitimacy as Congress is only as legitimate as strength and 
security of the ballot box. This is a shameful, partisan move by House 
Republicans that undermines our democracy.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-LA), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee 
on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, added the following:
``Voting is a fundamental right and the foundation of our democracy and 
it is essential that we maintain confidence in the integrity of the 
ballot box. Now that constant cyber attacks are our new reality, taking 
the appropriate security measures is more important than ever. If we 
are serious about protecting our electoral process we need to continue 
to make smart investments like the EAC that will help us reach that 
goal.''</paragraph>

In The News--Independent Commission Must Investigate President Trump's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Potential Russian Ties</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Feb. 27, 2017, BlackPressUSA</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The endurance of our Nation's security, sovereignty, and democracy 
is not a partisan issue. This is a top concern for all Americans and 
should be a top priority for the leaders that we send to Washington, 
whether Democrat or Republican. As elected officials, my colleagues and 
I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States 
against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We, therefore, have a 
responsibility to do our due diligence in investigating Russian 
interference, and potential influence, into our democratic elections 
and the potential Russian on-going connections within this current 
Presidential administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Despite all of the evidence gathered thus far--evidence that has 
led all 17 of the U.S. intelligence agencies to conclude with 
confidence that the Russians had indeed interfered in the past 
election--the current administration seems unable or unwilling to put 
its full weight behind a full and proper investigation that seems 
necessary to the American people. In the face of evidence that campaign 
and administration officials seem to have had relationships with 
Russian officials, the President cannot simply move on from this issue. 
In fact, the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn 
this month seems to provide us with more questions than answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The potential conflicts between the Trump administration and its 
apparent ties to Russia seem numerous. The President has refused to 
release his tax returns--a move not seen from any other modern major 
party candidate--leaving questions unanswered as to potential Russian 
business ties and conflicts of interest that President Trump was all 
too happy to gloat about in years past. The President is unable to 
criticize Russia and its dictator-like leader Vladimir Putin, but, 
instead, praises him and prefers him to President Obama. When 
confronted with the assertion that Putin has had journalists and 
political opponents killed, President Trump doubled down on his support 
of Putin by shockingly asserting a moral equivalence between Russia and 
the United States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The President's ties to Russia don't end with him, however, they 
trickle down into his administration. As in the campaign, President 
Trump continues to surround himself with advisers that have expansive 
and well-documented financial entanglements to Russia. Recently, The 
New York Times reported that phone records show Trump associates 
communicated with senior Russian intelligence officials throughout the 
campaign, including his former campaign chair Paul Manafort, who is 
known to have involvements in multimillion-dollar business deals with 
Putin allies in Ukraine. Additionally, Michael Flynn was forced to 
resign following information revealing that he had lied about privately 
discussing U.S. sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador to 
the United States before Trump took office, a potentially illegal act. 
It has since been reported that White House officials were made aware 
of Flynn's actions and made no effort to correct the record. It was 
only after leaks to the public that President Trump's hand was forced, 
raising concerns regarding the ability of this White House to maintain 
honest and open communication with the American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This intricate web leaves us with critical questions that must be 
answered. What did the President know and when? Was the White House 
ignoring or covering up the truth and spreading misinformation? Did 
Flynn operate at the direction or the knowledge of the President and 
were others involved? The American people deserve to know the full 
extent of Russia's financial, personal, and political strings attached 
to President Trump and this administration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Now more than ever, we need an independent, bipartisan commission 
to fully investigate Russia's interference in the election and any 
potential Trump campaign ties to the Kremlin. Unfortunately, Republican 
leaders in the House seem less than enthusiastic about investigating 
their own President. In turn, last month, Representatives Eric Swalwell 
(D-CA), and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) reintroduced legislation that would 
create a 12-member, bipartisan, independent commission empowered to 
conduct an in-depth investigation into attempts by the Russian 
government or others to use electronic means to influence, interfere 
with, or undermine trust in last year's elections. This would be 
similar to the highly-praised 9/11 Commission--which was led by well-
regarded National security experts that were not elected officials. 
Such a commission is not only necessary in order to ensure our 
security, but to restore trust in this administration and in the 
democratic process. All Democratic Members of the House of 
Representatives, along with one Republican, have co-sponsored this 
critical bipartisan legislation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The American people deserve transparency and peace of mind when it 
comes to their elected leadership. The Trump administration has 
insisted on remaining friendly with Russia despite the very clear 
threat that they have presented to our National security. In doing so, 
they have put our Nation at risk while keeping American citizens in the 
dark. The Trump administration's intent to ignore these on-going acts 
of aggression sends a message that this type of meddling is acceptable. 
The only democratic way forward is to launch a complete investigation 
into not only the interference into our democratic election, but also 
into the ties and communication that this administration has had with 
Russia.</paragraph>

Press Release--Pelosi, Thompson, Brady Announce Election Security Task</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Force</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Chairman McCaul">June 29, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--Today, as the Nation prepares to celebrate July 4th, 
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Committee on Homeland Security 
Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), and Committee on House 
Administration Ranking Member Robert Brady (D-PA) announced the 
formation of a Task Force to ensure the health and security of our 
Nation's election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Congressional Task Force on Election Security will address the 
lack of action to protect electoral infrastructure following Russia 
interfering and attempting to influence the 2016 Presidential election. 
According to the Department of Homeland Security, the election systems 
in 21 States were breached and voter records containing personal 
information were stolen. To this day, we have seen no action from the 
Republican Congress or the Trump administration to provide greater 
protection to our election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Congressional Task Force on Election Security is intended to be 
a forum for Members from the two committees to hear from experts with 
expertise in cybersecurity and election infrastructure and identify 
policy recommendations that can help ensure the integrity of our 
election systems and guard against future attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Leader Pelosi released the following statement on the Task Force:
``The integrity of our democracy itself is under threat from the 
Russians,'' said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. ``But we see an 
appalling absence of action, or even concern, from President Trump and 
Congressional Republicans. Democrats won't allow Putin's assault on 
American democracy to go unchallenged. With our Task Force on Election 
Security, House Democrats are continuing to pursue the facts and defend 
our democracy where Republicans won't.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Ranking Member Thompson added the following:
``Last year's Russian campaign to hack our political institutions and 
interfere with the Presidential election was a blatant attack on our 
democracy. If we continue to do nothing to protect the integrity of our 
election systems, we make it easy for Russia and other nefarious actors 
to impact future elections. Unfortunately, we have seen no effort from 
the Republican-led Congress or the Trump administration to address this 
vulnerability. Looking toward the future, we must be able to put 
politics aside for the good of the country and work together to protect 
against efforts to undermine our cherished democratic institutions. I 
look forward to working with Ranking Member Brady and my colleagues to 
get answers for the American people and prevent future damage to our 
democracy.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Ranking Member Brady added the following:
``We now know that Russia launched an unprecedented attack on our 
election infrastructure, and the intelligence community has indicated 
that foreign actors will be back in 2018 and 2020. Free, fair, and 
secure elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and Congress 
must take action to address this threat to our election security, and 
our National security. I look forward to working with my colleagues to 
identify the vulnerabilities in our voting systems and to take action 
to make our elections safer.''</paragraph>

  Press Release--Election Security Task Force Receives First Briefing</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Chairman McCaul">July 27, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--The Congressional Task Force on Election Security, 
chaired by Committee on Homeland Security Ranking Member Bennie G. 
Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration Ranking Member 
Robert Brady (D-PA) received its first information-gathering briefing 
to inform its work on securing our election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Task Force was briefed by the Brennan Center For Justice on its 
new report: Securing Elections From Foreign Interference. Brennan 
Center experts offered specific actions Congress and local election 
officials can quickly take to insulate voting technology from continued 
foreign interference. Their report focuses on assessing and securing 
two of the most vulnerable points in the system: voting machines, which 
could be hacked to cast doubt on or change vote totals; and voter 
registration databases, which could be manipulated in an attempt to 
block voters, cause disruption, and undermine confidence when citizens 
vote.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Co-Chairs Thompson and Brady released the below joint statement 
following the briefing:
``Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and targeting of voting 
infrastructure in at least 21 States was a direct attack on our 
democracy. The American people expect their Government to do whatever 
possible to prevent this from happening again. While Republicans refuse 
to look into this issue, we are taking the steps to begin an 
investigation into what we can do to secure our election infrastructure 
and prevent what transpired last year from happening again. The Brennan 
Center's expertise on election issues will lend us to our first public 
meeting in the coming weeks where we will hear from officials and 
experts with diverse backgrounds. This will be the first step toward 
forming solutions to protect our democracy and its cherished 
institutions from malicious actors and outside influence.''</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking 
Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, released the following 
statement on the news that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
has notified each State and territory whether or not their election 
systems were targeted during the 2016 election:
``Russia's priority in undermining confidence in our democratic 
institutions was clear during last year election and will only growing 
stronger. To counter this, there must be a strong relationship between 
DHS and its partners at the State level with the aim of keeping our 
election systems--part of our critical infrastructure--secure. While 
this should have happened much sooner, I am glad that DHS finally 
notified each State whether or not they were targeted by Russia. I urge 
DHS to keep building trusted relationships with State governments to 
carry out its responsibility to help States secure their election 
systems. Congress must also continue to do its part to investigate what 
happened last year, work to prevent it in the future, and ensure DHS 
has the resources it needs to protect these systems.''</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Co-Chairs Thompson and Brady released the below joint statement 
announcing the forum:
``Recent news reminds us that Russia targeted voting infrastructure in 
at least 21 States last year in a direct attack on our democracy. 
Looking forward, the American people expect us to investigate our 
vulnerabilities and do whatever possible to prevent this from happening

on how we can better secure our election infrastructure and prevent

    <paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Chairman McCaul">November 15, 2017</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--The Congressional Task Force on Election Security, 
chaired by Committee on Homeland Security Ranking Member Bennie G. 
Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration Ranking Member 
Robert Brady (D-PA) released its preliminary findings and 
recommendations marking 1 year since the 2016 election. Because of 
Republican inaction, the Task Force was created this summer to put 
forth solutions to secure our election systems after Russia interfered 
and attempted to influence last year's election. Just yesterday, 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions admitted to Congress that he could not 
report on any administration election security efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Over the past 5 months, the Task Force has held public forums with 
election and cybersecurity experts and has been working to understand 
the threats to election infrastructure and how to address them. The 5 
findings and 6 recommendations released today underline the Department 
of Homeland Security and the Election Assistance Commission as the 
primary agencies that can help States better secure their election 
systems. Today's preliminary findings will inform an upcoming final 
task force report.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Preliminary recommendations:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Maintain the designation of election infrastructure as a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Chairman McCaul">critical infrastructure subsector.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Help States fund and maintain secure election systems.
  &lt;bullet&gt; States should conduct post-election risk-limiting audits.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Empower Federal agencies to be effective partners for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Nation-wide security reforms.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Establish clear and effective channels for sharing threat</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Chairman McCaul">and intelligence information with election officials.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Prioritize cybersecurity training at the State and local</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Chairman McCaul">level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Congressman Thompson and Congressman Brady released the following 
statement:
``One year ago, 139 million Americans cast their vote in the wake of a 
massive Russian cyber-enabled influence operation designed to undermine 
confidence in our democracy. Russia also targeted voter registration 
databases in at least 21 States and sought to infiltrate the networks 
of voting equipment vendors, political parties, and at least one local 
election board. If we do nothing, this will become our new normal. With 
the next Federal election only 1 year away, it is high time we start 
thinking about enacting real solutions. The findings and 
recommendations released today are an outline of concrete steps that we 
can take to ensure our elections are more secure going forward.''</paragraph>

Press Release--Election Security Task Force Seeks Clarification On DHS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Role in Continuing Kobach Voter Fraud Commission</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Chairman McCaul">January 23, 2018
Despite no evidence of voter fraud, President Trump ordered DHS to 
examine nonexistent Commission findings and ``determine next course of 
action''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--Today, House Homeland Security Committee Ranking 
Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration 
Ranking Member Robert A. Brady (D-PA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional 
Task Force on Election Security, wrote to Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) Secretary Kristjen Nielsen seeking clarification 
regarding the Department's responsibilities related to the now-defunct 
Presidential Commission on Election Integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Commission was ostensibly established to investigate 
allegations of fraudulent voter registrations and fraudulent voting. 
However, the Members write this claim was substantiated by ``nothing 
more than the President's active imagination and frustration that he 
did not receive the majority of the popular votes cast in the 2016 
Presidential election.'' The letter notes the Commission was the 
subject of frequent criticism and legal action ``alleging violation of 
several Federal laws, including the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, the Privacy Act, the Hatch Act, and multiple State laws, 
among other things.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Chairman McCaul">After the commission was unable to produce any evidence of improper 
voting and registrations, the President abruptly terminated the 
commission. However, he nevertheless directed DHS to ``examine'' the 
Commission's initial findings and ``determine the next courses of 
action.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Members write:
``It is unclear how the Department will carry out this charge given 
that the Commission never produced any findings. We are concerned that 
directing DHS essentially to take over where the Commission left off 
could distract the Department from its pressing obligation to protect 
U.S. election systems from foreign interference and may undermine the 
burgeoning relationships DHS is building with State election 
officials.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Members request that DHS provide the following information 
related to their examination:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Any documents, files, electronic records, or information</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Chairman McCaul">that the Department has received or anticipates receiving from</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Chairman McCaul">the Commission, despite reports that all voter data will be</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Chairman McCaul">destroyed and that the Commission never made any findings.

    <paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Chairman McCaul">the President's decision to transfer the Commission's</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Chairman McCaul">responsibilities to DHS, including whether those additional</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--Today, House Homeland Security Committee Ranking 
Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration 
Ranking Member Robert A. Brady (D-PA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional 
Task Force on Election Security, released the below joint statement in 
reaction to Secretary of State Tillerson's comments on Russia already 
interfering in this year's elections.
``Secretary Tillerson confirmed what Congressional Democrats have known 
since the ODNI released its report on election meddling: Russia is 
determined to interfere in our elections and disrupt our democratic 
processes. His candid admission that we are no better prepared to stop 
them than we were in 2016 is a testament to President Trump's failure 
to acknowledge that Russia interfered in our elections once and is 
determined to do so again. His unwillingness to counter the threat 
should be appalling to all concerned Americans.''
``While Republicans in Congress have turned a blind eye, the Trump 
administration seems to do Putin's bidding. Congressional Democrats, 
however, have spent the last year identifying vulnerabilities in our 
election systems and figuring out what we need to do to secure them. 
Next week, the Congressional Task Force on Election Security, which we 
chair, will be releasing its final report, recommendations, and new 
legislation to give our elections systems a much-needed update.''
``Congress fought hard to protect the integrity of elections against 
hanging chads 15 years ago, and certainly we should act to protect our 
elections from the Russian government today. It's time for Republicans 
to wake up and join us in protecting our democracy from Putin.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Election Security Task Force wrote the House Appropriations 
Committee last November stressing the need to appropriate the remaining 
$400 million already authorized for election infrastructure under the

    <paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Chairman McCaul">February 27, 2018</paragraph>

on Election Security, House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member 
Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration Ranking 
Member Robert A. Brady (D-PA), released the below joint statement on 
the need for election security measures following Admiral Mike Rogers' 
testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee today. At the 
hearing, the National Security Agency (NSA) Director and U.S. Cyber 
Command Commander told Senators that President Trump has not given him 
orders to counter Russian interference in our elections.
``It is unimaginable that the President of the United States has not 
ordered NSA Director Rogers--or apparently the heads of any other 
agency--to stop Russia from meddling in our elections. This is a clear 
invitation for Putin to continue to do what he pleases with American 
sovereignty and our democratic institutions. Let us be clear: This 
inaction is the President abdicating his oath of office. While spending 
time on Twitter falsely alleging a witch hunt, he is not keeping the 
country safe and secure.
``With a President unwilling or unable to put the country and its 
security first, Congress must act. We call on Republicans and Democrats 
to come together and pass clearly-needed election security reforms. The 
Congressional Task Force on Election Security introduced legislation 
earlier this month--H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act--that would 
provide assistance to States to help secure their elections systems and 
protect our democratic institutions from Russian efforts to undermine 
them. We hope that our Republican colleagues can join us and put 
politics aside so we secure our elections--the hallmark of our 
democracy--from Russian interference.''</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Chairman McCaul">It has been over a year since Russia's unprecedented assault on the 
country's elections in 2016--including targeting 21 States' voting 
systems. These attacks exposed serious National security 
vulnerabilities to our election infrastructure--which includes voting 
machines and voter registration databases. Since that time, the Trump 
administration and Republican leadership in Congress--despite their 
oath of office to protect against enemies foreign and domestic--have 
refused to address the issue or put forth any solutions to close these

    <paragraph paraId="580" speaker="Chairman McCaul">March 21, 2018</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="581" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking 
Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, released the 
following statement after receiving written notice from Committee 
Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) that he will not convene a hearing 
dedicated to election security as he indicated publicly on March 7. 
While promising to work with Democrats on this issue as soon as 
possible, Chairman McCaul said: ``I look forward to working with you to 
conducting a full hearing on this issue as it not only impacted--was a 
real event in the last Presidential election--but I believe it will be 
a real event in the mid-term 2018 elections.'' Today, Homeland Security 
Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testified before the Senate Intelligence 
Committee that our elections are ``clearly potential targets for 
Russian hacking attempts.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="582" speaker="Chairman McCaul">``I am extremely disappointed that Chairman McCaul has already 
backtracked on his public promise to hold a much-needed hearing on 
election security and the on-going Russia cyber threat. This also comes 
after repeated overtures last year to work together on this issue. 
Alas, we have made no progress. To be clear, we first began hearing of 
Russia's interference in our elections almost 2 years ago.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="583" speaker="Chairman McCaul">``Chairman McCaul often reiterates his opposition to Russia, but 
actions speak louder than words. Like Speaker Ryan and his fellow House 
Chairmen, he is ensuring the House stays true in its partisanship and 
seems too willing to do President Trump's bidding. Homeland security 
used to be a bipartisan issue, but it seems this is no longer possible 
when one party refuses to put the country--and its security--first.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="584" speaker="Chairman McCaul">``Holding a focused and comprehensive hearing on election security 
is not a partisan or complicated request. It speaks volumes that while 
Chairman McCaul has been dragging his feet on this issue for over a 
year, the Senate is holding election security hearings today with 
current and former homeland security officials. This is all we are 
asking for. I call on Chairman McCaul to realize his error and follow 
through on his promise.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="585" speaker="Chairman McCaul">``If Chairman McCaul believes Russia will interfere in the 2018 
elections, as he has stated, we cannot ignore this threat. Having 
hearings on election security--while developing solutions and showing 
the public that we are working together on this issue is a solid first 
step. The 2018 elections are only 7 months away and we must be doing 
much more to protect them. If we do nothing, we are just inviting Putin 
to what he pleases with our democracy and our domestic affairs.''</paragraph>

on election security to be able to go into the detail necessary to 
properly educate Members of Congress on the Trump administration's 
efforts--or lack thereof--to secure our election systems from foreign

House of Representative's election security briefing today:
``I was shocked to hear that Secretary Nielsen has apparently not 
bothered to read the January 2017 intelligence community assessment 
that Russia interfered in our elections and undermined our democratic 
process to help President Trump win. This report is over a year old, 
has stood the test of time, was agreed to by the entire intelligence 
community, and was backed up by Senate investigators. The fact that she 
did not seem aware of the report's findings while briefing Members of 
Congress on the very important topic of election security is appalling 
to all who have tried to make progress on this issue since 2016 with 
little help from Republicans or this administration. I sincerely hope 
the Secretary's comments today were not just rhetorical gymnastics to 
placate the President.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="594" speaker="Chairman McCaul">``Even though this report is widely available, I will be sure to 
deliver the Secretary a copy. After today's briefing, it is clear that 
our Government must do more, and whatever possible, to secure our 
elections from foreign interference. The integrity of our democracy is 
at stake and comments like those from the Secretary today are not 
helpful.''</paragraph>

   Press Release--Thompson Statement on Mueller Indicating Election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="596" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Meddling On-going</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="597" speaker="Chairman McCaul">June 21, 2018</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="598" speaker="Chairman McCaul">(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking 
Member of the Committee on Homeland Security and co-Chair of the 
Congressional Task Force on Election Security, released the following 
statement on news from Special Counsel Robert Mueller that election 
meddling operations are still on-going:
``As Robert Mueller confirmed today, the threat to our elections from 
foreign interference persists and it is high time the White House wakes 
up and takes this threat seriously. Inaction will have grave 
consequences for public confidence in the integrity of our democracy. 
It is unacceptable that the Government official most directly 
communicating on the on-going threat to our elections is the Special 
Counsel.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="599" speaker="Chairman McCaul">``President Trump must start acting like the President of the 
country instead of obsessing over photo ops with Kim Jong-un, saving 
ZTE jobs in China, and casting aside close allies like Canada to curry 
favor with Vladimir Putin. Anything less is an abdication of his oath 
of office. With the mid-term elections less than 5 months away, he must 
make it clear that election security is the top National security 
priority and push Republicans in Congress to do more.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="600" speaker="Chairman McCaul">It has been over 3 months since Congressman Thompson introduced 
H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act to help secure our voting systems. 
The legislation, with 105 co-sponsors, has still not received a hearing 
or a vote.</paragraph>

Congressional Task Force on Election Security Preliminary Findings and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="606" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Recommendations</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="607" speaker="Chairman McCaul">One year ago, 139 million Americans cast their vote in the wake of 
a massive Russian cyber-enabled influence operation designed to 
``undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate 
Secretary [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential 
presidency.'' Using a vast network of social media trolls, fake ``bot'' 
accounts, and state-owned news outlets, the Kremlin spread 
disinformation to the American electorate through more than 1,000 
YouTube videos, 130,000 tweets, and 80,000 Facebook posts viewed by as 
many as 150 million people on Facebook platforms alone. They hacked 
into U.S. political organizations, selectively exposing sensitive 
personal information about DNC staffers using third-party 
intermediaries like WikiLeaks. Finally, according to U.S. intelligence 
reports, Russia targeted voter registration databases in at least 21 
States and sought to infiltrate the networks of voting equipment 
vendors, political parties, and at least one local election board.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="608" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Although this election cycle was unlike any before, the U.S. 
intelligence community warns that it may be the ``New Normal.'' Recent 
reports show that the vast majority of U.S. States are still relying on 
outdated, insecure voting equipment and other election technologies 
that lack even basic cybersecurity standards. Meanwhile, Republicans in 
Congress have shown little interest in fighting Russian interference, 
and have instead chosen to act on measures that would eliminate rather 
than bolster funding for the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the 
Federal agency responsible for helping States secure these vulnerable 
systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="609" speaker="Chairman McCaul">With just over a year until the 2018 midterm elections, it is 
important that we reflect on lessons learned in the last year and focus 
the spotlight on election security to push for reforms that protect the 
integrity of the ballot box.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="610" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Congressional Task Force on Election Security has spent the 
past 5 months working together to understand the threats to election 
infrastructure and how to address them. The Task Force found:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Election security is National security, and our election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="611" speaker="Chairman McCaul">infrastructure is critical infrastructure.--Federal law defines</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="612" speaker="Chairman McCaul">critical infrastructure as systems and assets for which</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="613" speaker="Chairman McCaul">``incapacity or destruction . . . would have a debilitating</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="614" speaker="Chairman McCaul">impact on security, National economic security, National public</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="615" speaker="Chairman McCaul">health or safety,'' or any combination thereof. Such</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="616" speaker="Chairman McCaul">infrastructure is given priority access to threat intelligence,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="617" speaker="Chairman McCaul">incident response, technical assistance, and other products and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="618" speaker="Chairman McCaul">services to help owners and operators harden their defenses. It</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="619" speaker="Chairman McCaul">is hard to imagine a system failure that would inflict more</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="620" speaker="Chairman McCaul">damage than a foreign adversary infiltrating our voting systems</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="621" speaker="Chairman McCaul">to hijack our democratic process. Nonetheless, Trump's Homeland</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="622" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Security Department (DHS) has wavered on its commitment to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="623" speaker="Chairman McCaul">honor the Obama administration's decision to designate election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="624" speaker="Chairman McCaul">systems as a critical infrastructure subsector. Whether the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="625" speaker="Chairman McCaul">next Secretary of Homeland Security will take a firm stand and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="626" speaker="Chairman McCaul">maintain the designation remains to be seen.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Our election infrastructure is vulnerable.--Many elections</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="627" speaker="Chairman McCaul">across our country are being run on equipment that is either</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="628" speaker="Chairman McCaul">obsolete or near the end of its useful life. In over 40 States,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="629" speaker="Chairman McCaul">elections are carried out using voting machines and voter</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="630" speaker="Chairman McCaul">registration databases created more than a decade ago. These</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="631" speaker="Chairman McCaul">technologies are more likely to suffer from known</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="632" speaker="Chairman McCaul">vulnerabilities that cannot be patched easily, if at all. As we</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="633" speaker="Chairman McCaul">saw at this year's DEFCON Voting Village, even hackers with</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="634" speaker="Chairman McCaul">limited prior knowledge, tools, and resources are able to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="635" speaker="Chairman McCaul">breach voting machines in a matter of minutes.
  &lt;bullet&gt; These vulnerable systems are being targeted by one of the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="636" speaker="Chairman McCaul">world's most sophisticated cyber actors.--According to the U.S.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="637" speaker="Chairman McCaul">intelligence community, Russian interference in the 2016</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="638" speaker="Chairman McCaul">election ``demonstrated a significant escalation in directness,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="639" speaker="Chairman McCaul">level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="640" speaker="Chairman McCaul">operations,'' and warned that ``Moscow will apply lessons</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="641" speaker="Chairman McCaul">learned from . . . the U.S. Presidential election to future</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="642" speaker="Chairman McCaul">influence efforts world-wide, including against U.S. allies and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="643" speaker="Chairman McCaul">their election processes.'' We cannot reasonably assume that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="644" speaker="Chairman McCaul">State voting systems are secure enough to withstand a state-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="645" speaker="Chairman McCaul">sponsored cyber attack, and we have no reason to believe these</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="646" speaker="Chairman McCaul">attacks will subside.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Fortunately, many of the security solutions and best</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="647" speaker="Chairman McCaul">practices are already known.--We can mitigate many</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="648" speaker="Chairman McCaul">vulnerabilities with existing, time-tested cybersecurity fixes</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="649" speaker="Chairman McCaul">found in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the CIS ``Top</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="650" speaker="Chairman McCaul">20'' Critical Security Controls. By adopting even the Top 5</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="651" speaker="Chairman McCaul">security controls, organizations can thwart 85 percent of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="652" speaker="Chairman McCaul">common cyber attacks. Security experts also tend to agree on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="653" speaker="Chairman McCaul">the types of voting systems most susceptible to compromise, and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="654" speaker="Chairman McCaul">are urging election officials to phase out paperless Direct</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="655" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Recording Electronic (DRE) machines, replace these machines</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="656" speaker="Chairman McCaul">with voter-marked paper ballots, and carry out risk-limiting</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="657" speaker="Chairman McCaul">audits to verify election results.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Federal agencies like DHS and EAC are important partners in</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="658" speaker="Chairman McCaul">this effort, but they need resources and consistent support</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="659" speaker="Chairman McCaul">from Congress.--We have a rare window of opportunity to promote</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="660" speaker="Chairman McCaul">the widespread adoption of common-sense security measures that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="661" speaker="Chairman McCaul">protect the integrity of the ballot box. This is not the time</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="662" speaker="Chairman McCaul">to diminish Federal efforts or shut down important lines of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="663" speaker="Chairman McCaul">dialog between DHS and election administrators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="664" speaker="Chairman McCaul">DHS is able to provide participating State and local governments</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="665" speaker="Chairman McCaul">with cyber threat intelligence, vulnerability assessments,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="666" speaker="Chairman McCaul">penetration testing, scanning of databases and operating</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="667" speaker="Chairman McCaul">systems, and other cybersecurity services at no cost. Despite</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="668" speaker="Chairman McCaul">some initial confusion about the critical infrastructure</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="669" speaker="Chairman McCaul">designation, DHS has worked to build relationships with</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="670" speaker="Chairman McCaul">election officials, clarify the voluntary nature of DHS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="671" speaker="Chairman McCaul">services, resolve disparities in information sharing and victim</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="672" speaker="Chairman McCaul">notification, and assist the subsector in formally establishing</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="673" speaker="Chairman McCaul">a Coordinating Council, which had its first meeting this fall.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="674" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Where DHS has rendered assistance, officials report that cyber</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="675" speaker="Chairman McCaul">hygiene scans and other services are valuable. However, there</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="676" speaker="Chairman McCaul">is currently a 9-month wait list for Risk and Vulnerability</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="677" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Assessments, and questions remain about how to ensure threat</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="678" speaker="Chairman McCaul">information reaches election officials, many of whom lack</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="679" speaker="Chairman McCaul">security clearances.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="680" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The EAC has been a valuable partner to State and county election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="681" speaker="Chairman McCaul">officials. The agency has played a crucial role in election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="682" speaker="Chairman McCaul">security by serving as a clearinghouse of information for State</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="683" speaker="Chairman McCaul">and local election officials, facilitating communications</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="684" speaker="Chairman McCaul">between these officials and DHS, providing easy-to-use</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="685" speaker="Chairman McCaul">cybersecurity guidance, and testing and certifying voting</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="686" speaker="Chairman McCaul">machines. Numerous State and local officials have expressed</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="687" speaker="Chairman McCaul">support and appreciation for the agency's work. Unfortunately,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="688" speaker="Chairman McCaul">in recent years Republicans have made several attempts to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="689" speaker="Chairman McCaul">terminate the agency. Instead, Congress should support the EAC</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="690" speaker="Chairman McCaul">and provide it with the resources it needs to help States</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="691" speaker="Chairman McCaul">secure their election systems. In addition, the President</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="692" speaker="Chairman McCaul">should nominate and the Senate should confirm a fourth</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="693" speaker="Chairman McCaul">commissioner to the EAC so that the agency can operate with its</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="694" speaker="Chairman McCaul">full slate of commissioners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="695" speaker="Chairman McCaul">In light of its preliminary findings, the Task Force makes the 
following recommendations:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Maintain the designation of election infrastructure as a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="696" speaker="Chairman McCaul">critical infrastructure subsector.--This designation ensures</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="697" speaker="Chairman McCaul">that State and local election officials receive prioritized</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="698" speaker="Chairman McCaul">access to DHS's cybersecurity services. Defining election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="699" speaker="Chairman McCaul">systems as critical infrastructure means these systems will, on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="700" speaker="Chairman McCaul">a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for DHS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="701" speaker="Chairman McCaul">cybersecurity assistance. These services are an important force</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="702" speaker="Chairman McCaul">multiplier, especially at the State and local level, where</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="703" speaker="Chairman McCaul">resources are scarce.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Help States fund and maintain secure election systems.--We</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="704" speaker="Chairman McCaul">cannot ask our State and local election officials to take on a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="705" speaker="Chairman McCaul">State actor like Russia alone. Although States and counties are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="706" speaker="Chairman McCaul">largely responsible for elections, Congress has a role to play</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="707" speaker="Chairman McCaul">in helping States fund the purchase of newer, more secure</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="708" speaker="Chairman McCaul">election systems, and requiring such systems adhere to baseline</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="709" speaker="Chairman McCaul">cybersecurity standards. Election officials need money to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="710" speaker="Chairman McCaul">replace aging voting systems, many of which do not provide an</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="711" speaker="Chairman McCaul">auditable paper trail. It is important to note, however, that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="712" speaker="Chairman McCaul">cyber threats evolve at a rapid pace, and a one-time lump sum</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="713" speaker="Chairman McCaul">investment is not enough. States also need resources for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="714" speaker="Chairman McCaul">maintenance and periodic upgrades, and cybersecurity training</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="715" speaker="Chairman McCaul">for poll workers and other election officials.
  &lt;bullet&gt; States should conduct post-election risk-limiting audits.--A</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="716" speaker="Chairman McCaul">risk-limiting audit involves hand counting a certain number of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="717" speaker="Chairman McCaul">ballots to determine whether the reported election outcome was</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="718" speaker="Chairman McCaul">correct. Risk-limiting audits used advanced statistical methods</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="719" speaker="Chairman McCaul">to enable States to determine that the original vote count was</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="720" speaker="Chairman McCaul">accurate with a high degree of confidence. These audits are</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="721" speaker="Chairman McCaul">useful in detecting any incorrect election outcomes, whether</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="722" speaker="Chairman McCaul">they are caused by a cyber attack or something more mundane</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="723" speaker="Chairman McCaul">like a programming error. Moreover, conducting these audits as</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="724" speaker="Chairman McCaul">a matter of course increases public confidence in the election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="725" speaker="Chairman McCaul">system.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Empower Federal agencies to be effective partners in pushing</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="726" speaker="Chairman McCaul">out Nation-wide security reforms.--With mid-term elections in a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="727" speaker="Chairman McCaul">year, election officials cannot afford to wait 9 months for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="728" speaker="Chairman McCaul">valuable cybersecurity services like Risk and Vulnerability</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="729" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Assessments. At the same time, we cannot ask DHS to deliver</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="730" speaker="Chairman McCaul">election assistance at the expense of its other critical</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="731" speaker="Chairman McCaul">infrastructure customers. We should give DHS the resources it</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="732" speaker="Chairman McCaul">needs to provide election officials with timely assessments and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="733" speaker="Chairman McCaul">other cybersecurity services, without detracting from its</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="734" speaker="Chairman McCaul">overall critical infrastructure mission. Similarly, Congress</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="735" speaker="Chairman McCaul">should fund EAC at a level commensurate with its expanded role</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="736" speaker="Chairman McCaul">in election cybersecurity and confirm a fourth commissioner so</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="737" speaker="Chairman McCaul">the agency is able to continue to serve as a resource on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="738" speaker="Chairman McCaul">election administration.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Establish clear and effective channels for sharing threat</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="739" speaker="Chairman McCaul">and intelligence information with election officials.--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="740" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Effective information sharing is critical to address the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="741" speaker="Chairman McCaul">decentralized threat that our Nation faces in terms of securing</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="742" speaker="Chairman McCaul">our elections. Prior to the 2016 elections, we have seen how</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="743" speaker="Chairman McCaul">information sharing failures can cause catastrophic events. The</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="744" speaker="Chairman McCaul">9/11 terrorist attacks exposed serious gaps in information</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="745" speaker="Chairman McCaul">sharing within the Federal Government and State and local law</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="746" speaker="Chairman McCaul">enforcement partners. It is imperative that election officials</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="747" speaker="Chairman McCaul">have access to the most timely and high-level security</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="748" speaker="Chairman McCaul">information. Chief election officials in each State should have</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="749" speaker="Chairman McCaul">expedited access to security clearances. DHS needs a formalized</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="750" speaker="Chairman McCaul">process to provide real-time appropriate threat information to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="751" speaker="Chairman McCaul">State and local election officials to improve information flow</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="752" speaker="Chairman McCaul">and help prevent intrusions in our election infrastructure.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Prioritize cybersecurity training at the State and local</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="753" speaker="Chairman McCaul">level.--The events of 2016 demonstrate that human error is a</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="754" speaker="Chairman McCaul">significant vulnerability as it leaves systems open to spear-</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="755" speaker="Chairman McCaul">phishing and other forms of cyber attack. States and localities</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="756" speaker="Chairman McCaul">face the daunting task of training hundreds, if not thousands,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="757" speaker="Chairman McCaul">of election officials, IT staff, and poll workers on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="758" speaker="Chairman McCaul">cybersecurity and risk mitigation. It costs money for States to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="759" speaker="Chairman McCaul">produce training materials, and takes staff time to implement</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="760" speaker="Chairman McCaul">State-wide training programs. The Federal Government should</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="761" speaker="Chairman McCaul">provide training support either through the EAC or by providing</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="762" speaker="Chairman McCaul">funding to States to assist with their training programs.</paragraph>

    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="773" speaker="Mr. Thompson">H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act,
currently has over 100 cosponsors, all Democrats. The 
legislation would, among other things, provide on-going support 
to State and local governments to secure election 
infrastructure, instead of addressing election challenges 
crisis to crisis; direct the Department of Homeland Security to 
address the resources it needs to carry out its election 
security responsibilities, and submit a request to Congress, 
and establish mechanisms to ensure that State election 
officials have timely access to actionable threat information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="774" speaker="Mr. Thompson">I have asked the committee to consider H.R. 5011 and today 
renew my request for consideration of this legislation. Even 
though Congress appropriated some additional funding for DHS 
and the States to improve election security in the fiscal year 
2018 omnibus, it was merely a downpayment of what is required. 
H.R. 5011 would help provide the States with the appropriate 
level of funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="775" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Today's other witness, Rhode Island's secretary of state, 
Nellie Gorbea, participated in one of our task force forums in 
October. She provided important insight into the resources the 
Federal Government was making available to States, the 
resources States need to secure election infrastructure, and 
proactive activities she was undertaking at the State level to 
improve election security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="776" speaker="Mr. Thompson">I am glad that the secretary is here with us today. Again, 
I look forward to her and Under Secretary Kreb's testimony. 
Securing our elections is part and parcel to securing our 
Democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="777" speaker="Mr. Thompson">With that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="778" speaker="Mr. Thompson">[The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="780" speaker="Mr. Thompson">July 11, 2018</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="781" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Under Secretary Krebs, you have taken this job at a critical moment 
for our Nation; however, I am concerned you do not have the support you 
need from the White House. You are responsible for building private-
sector confidence in DHS's information-sharing programs like Automated 
Indicator Sharing, after President Trump toyed with the idea of 
planting an absurd story to discredit it for his own political 
purposes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="782" speaker="Mr. Thompson">You are responsible for securing Federal networks at a time when 
the White House's National Security Advisor has decided to eliminate 
the National Security Council's cybersecurity coordinator. You are 
responsible for helping secure critical infrastructure networks for a 
White House that would rather save jobs in China than heed the advice 
of the intelligence community on supply chain vulnerabilities. And you 
are responsible for helping State and local governments secure election 
infrastructure following Russia's brazen election meddling efforts in 
2016, which the President has been reluctant to call out and which 
Congressional Republicans, until recently, were content to ignore.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="783" speaker="Mr. Thompson">As we sit here today, President Trump is in Europe complicating 
your mission. Instead of working with our European allies to confront 
Russia--a shared adversary whose attempts to undermine Western 
democratic institutions are growing more and more bold--he is trolling 
them to curry favor with Russian President Vladimir Putin. President 
Trump has said he will address Russia's 2016 election meddling in a 
meeting with Putin, but he has never demonstrated a credible ability to 
confront Putin with our intelligence community's findings. He has 
predicted his meeting with Putin ``may be the easiest,'' so I have no 
reason to believe anything productive will come of it. This President's 
failure to take seriously the threat to our democracy is one of the 
main reasons that we must do effective and thorough oversight in this 
body.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="784" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Although I am pleased that the Majority has finally scheduled 
today's hearing, I am disappointed that the Majority failed to invite a 
full range of stakeholders, including the Election Assistance 
Commission, or hold the hearing at a time when DHS's Federal partners 
were available to participate. It is important to note for the record 
that committee Democrats have been requesting official oversight 
activities on election security since before the 2016 election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="785" speaker="Mr. Thompson">And in March 2017, after months of inaction by the Republican 
majority, I introduced a Resolution of Inquiry seeking information from 
the Department on its activities related to countering Russian election 
interference in the 2016 Presidential election so we would understand 
how to protect our elections in the future. It was unceremoniously 
rejected along party lines.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="786" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Committee Democrats have written to the Chairman no less than five 
times since August 2016 to request a hearing, briefing, or 
investigation on vulnerabilities to our election infrastructure. We 
have also reiterated these requests on numerous occasions on the 
record. Despite these repeated requests, this committee did not conduct 
a formal hearing or briefing on the topic until April 2018--15 months 
after the intelligence community released its report concluding that 
the Russian government had attempted to interfere in the 2016 elections 
and would attempt to do so again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="787" speaker="Mr. Thompson">When the Trump administration's six top intelligence officials 
testified before the Senate that Russia was targeting our 2018 
elections, this committee--the committee that prides itself on acting 
in the wake of current issues--followed suit of the House Republican 
Conference by shirking its responsibility to act on this urgent threat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="788" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Ranking Members of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 
the Foreign Affairs Committee, Judiciary Committee, the Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Armed Services, and the 
House Administration Committee have all urged their Chairs or Speaker 
Ryan to aggressively address this on-going National security threat. 
Our calls for action were ignored, responded to with a half-hearted 
acknowledgement of the threat and a vague promise for future action, or 
the offer to ask a Government witness about election security at a 
hearing on another topic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="789" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Because our requests for thorough hearings and briefings were 
denied, some committee Democrats joined with Democrats on the Committee 
on House Administration to form the Congressional Task Force on 
Election Security. I openly asked Republicans to join us and submit 
their ideas, yet no Republican Member provided their input or attended 
the task force's public events.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="790" speaker="Mr. Thompson">After studying the topic for 8 months, meeting with stakeholders, 
and holding a series of forums and briefings, the Task Force produced a 
report and introduced legislation to implement the recommendations. 
H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act, currently has over 100 co-
sponsors--all Democrats. The legislation would, among other things:
  &lt;bullet&gt; provide on-going support to State and local governments to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="791" speaker="Mr. Thompson">secure election infrastructure, instead of addressing election</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="792" speaker="Mr. Thompson">challenges crisis-to-crisis;
  &lt;bullet&gt; direct the Department of Homeland Security to assess the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="793" speaker="Mr. Thompson">resources it needs to carry out its election security</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="794" speaker="Mr. Thompson">responsibilities and submit a request to Congress; and
  &lt;bullet&gt; establish mechanisms to ensure that State election officials</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="795" speaker="Mr. Thompson">have timely access to actionable threat information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="796" speaker="Mr. Thompson">I have asked this committee to consider H.R. 5011, and today renew 
my request for consideration of this legislation. Even though Congress 
appropriated some additional funding for DHS and the States to improve 
election security in the fiscal year 2018 omnibus, it was merely a 
down-payment on what is required. H.R. 5011 would help provide the 
States with the appropriate level of funding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="797" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Today's other witness, Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie 
Gorbea, participated in one of our Task Force forums in October. She 
provided important insight into the resources the Federal Government 
was making available to States, the resources States need to secure 
election infrastructure, and proactive activities she was undertaking 
at the State level to improve election security. I am glad that 
Secretary Gorbea is here with us again today, and I look forward to her 
and Under Secretary Krebs' testimony. Securing our elections is part 
and parcel to securing our democracy.

    <paragraph paraId="801" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Statement of Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="802" speaker="Chairman McCaul">July 11, 2018</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="803" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson thank you for holding 
today's hearing so that the committee may learn more about ``DHS 
Progress in Security Election Systems and Other Critical 
Infrastructure.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="804" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I thank today's witnesses:
  &lt;bullet&gt; The Honorable Christopher Krebs, Under Secretary, National</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="805" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Protection and Programs Directorate with the Department of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="806" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Homeland Security; and
  &lt;bullet&gt; The Honorable Nellie Gorbea, Secretary of State, State of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="807" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Rhode Island.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="808" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I thank each of you for bringing your expert view of the cyber 
threats against our Nation's system of elections and other matters 
regarding the security of critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="809" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The House Committee on Homeland Security has the responsibility of 
providing for the cybersecurity of Federal civilian agencies as well as 
the to secure the Nation's 16 critical infrastructure sectors from 
cyber and other threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="810" speaker="Chairman McCaul">On January 6, 2017, Homeland Security Secretary Johnson designated 
election systems as critical infrastructure, and created a new 
subsector under the existing Government Facilities Sector designation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="811" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Election Infrastructure Subsector covers a wide range of 
physical and electronic assets such as storage facilities, polling 
places, and centralized vote tabulation locations used to support the 
election process, and information and communications technology to 
include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other 
systems to manage the election process and report and display results 
on behalf of State and local governments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="812" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The process established for contacting and working with local and 
State elections administrators seems to be working well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="813" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The work to secure our Nation's election system from cyber threats 
is on-going, which is why this hearing is relevant.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="814" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) mission in 
cybersecurity and infrastructure protection is focused on enhancing 
greater collaboration on cybersecurity across the 16 critical 
infrastructure sectors and the sharing of cyber threat information 
between the private sector and Federal, State, and local partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="815" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I thank Ranking Member Thompson for his leadership in co-chairing 
the Congressional Task Force on Election Security, which issued a 
report earlier this year which outlined areas of concern regarding the 
security of election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="816" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Leader Pelosi convened the Task Force after waiting a year for the 
leadership of the House to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 
U.S. Elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="817" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We know the threats that computing devices and systems face, which 
are almost too numerous to count:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Bot-nets;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Ransom-ware;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Zero Day Events;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Mal-ware;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Denial of Service Attacks;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Pharming;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Phishing;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Data Theft;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Data Breaches;
  &lt;bullet&gt; SQL Injection;
  &lt;bullet&gt; Man-in-the-middle attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="818" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The list goes on, but suffice it to say that as hard as one person 
in our Government is working to stop cyber attacks there are likely 
another thousand attempting to breach a system or device owned by a 
United States citizen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="819" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This is why I introduced H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability 
Disclosure Reporting Act, which passed the House earlier this year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="820" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a 
report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber 
vulnerability disclosures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="821" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The report will include an annex with information on instances in 
which cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures 
were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing 
systems that or digital devices at risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="822" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The report will provide information on the degree to which the 
information provided by DHS was used by industry and other 
stakeholders.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="823" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of 
Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical 
infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate 
cyber vulnerabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="824" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The reason that I worked to bring this bill before the full House 
for consideration is the problem often referred to as a ``Zero Day 
Event.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="825" speaker="Chairman McCaul">A Zero Day Event describes the situation that network security 
professionals may find themselves when a previously unknown error or 
flaw in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="826" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The term ``Zero Day Event'' simply means that there is zero time to 
prepare a defense against a cyber attack.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="827" speaker="Chairman McCaul">When a defect in software is discovered then network engineers and 
software companies can work to develop a ``patch'' to fix the problem 
before it can be exploited by those who may seek to do harm.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="828" speaker="Chairman McCaul">H.R. 3202 seeks a report on the on-going Department of Homeland 
Security's policies and procedures for coordinating cyber vulnerability 
disclosures such as Zero Day Events with private-sector partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="829" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries it is important 
that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not 
routinely made available neither to the public nor to Congress.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="830" speaker="Chairman McCaul">H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand 
the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security 
and the benefit these disclosures may have for private-sector entities 
participating in programs in support of cybersecurity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="831" speaker="Chairman McCaul">During the 2016 election we learned of new threats from cyber space 
that go far beyond any that would have been considered in previous 
elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="832" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Russia targeted our Presidential Election according to the report, 
``Background to Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent 
U.S. Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution,'' 
provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's 
National Intelligence Council.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="833" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Russia used every cyber espionage tool available to influence the 
outcome of the Presidential election by using a multi-faceted campaign 
that included theft of data; strategically timed release of stolen 
information; production of fake news; and manipulation of facts to 
avoid blame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="834" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) is 
suspected by our intelligence agencies of having begun cyber operations 
targeting the United States election as early as March 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="835" speaker="Chairman McCaul">They took on the persona of ``Guccifer 2.0,'' ``DCLeaks.com,'' and 
Wikileaks as the identities that would be reported as having 
involvement in the work they had undertaken to undermine our Nation's 
Presidential election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="836" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Russia is blamed for breaching 21 local and State election systems, 
which they studied extensively.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="837" speaker="Chairman McCaul">In February 2018, special counsel Robert Mueller released 
indictments of 13 Russians, at least one of whom has direct ties to 
Russian President Vladimir Putin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="838" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The 37-page indictment details the actions taken to interfere with 
the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. Presidential 
election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="839" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Among the charges, which include charges for obstruction of 
justice, are several especially notable details.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="840" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The indictment states that 13 defendants posed as U.S. persons and 
created false U.S. personas and operated social media pages and groups 
designed to attract U.S. audiences.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="841" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The social media profiles ``addressed divisive U.S. political and 
social issues'' and falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="842" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The defendants are also accused of using ``the stolen identities of 
real U.S. persons to post on social media accounts'' which, over time, 
became the chosen ``means to reach significant numbers of Americans for 
purposes of interfering with the U.S. political system, including the 
Presidential election of 2016.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="843" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The goal of the effort was to sow discord in the U.S. political 
system, including the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="844" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The internet does not sleep--and nor do our Nation's on-line 
adversaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="845" speaker="Chairman McCaul">That Russia used cyber intrusions to attack United States political 
institutions to collect data to manipulate the media and the public 
with the purpose of influencing the outcome of the 2016 Presidential 
elections is now an undisputed fact.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="846" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The United States has enemies in other corners of the globe who 
would not hesitate to attack our election system if given the chance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="847" speaker="Chairman McCaul">These foreign adversaries do not share our commitment to democracy, 
liberty, and human rights, or the precious freedoms we hold dear.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="848" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This Congress must do its job and delve into the issue of Russian 
involvement in our National election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="849" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The work today must focus on election recovery should a serious 
cyber incident occur during an election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="850" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Vulnerabilities of computing systems are not limited to intentional 
attacks, but can include acts of nature, human error, or technology 
failing to perform as intended.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="851" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I am particularly concerned that so many jurisdictions rely on 
electronic poll books, to check in voters before issuing them ballots, 
with no paper backups; and the use of paperless electronic voting 
machines without sufficient paper ballot options in polling locations 
should they be needed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="852" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The right and better approach to election cybersecurity is to be 
prepared and not need options for voters to cast ballots, should voting 
systems fail, rather than being unprepared and needing options for 
voters to cast ballots during an election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="853" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We must be steadfast in our resolve to have a strong shield to 
defend civilian and critical infrastructure networks for all threats 
foreign and domestic.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="854" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I look forward to the testimony of today's witnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="855" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="856" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Just for the record, we had the Secretary
testify before this committee, it was openly available on this 
topic. We had a Classified briefing for all House members on 
election security.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="857" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We have been waiting for Under Secretary Krebs to get 
confirmed by the Senate, and, sir, we just congratulate on your 
confirmation by the U.S. Senate. We are fortunate, now, to have 
you here today to talk about this issue. I also think that the 
administration is going to be well-served by you, sir, and they 
are lucky to have you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="858" speaker="Chairman McCaul">On June 15, 2018, Chris Krebs was sworn in as the under 
secretary for the Department of Homeland Security's National 
Protection and Programs Directorate after being confirmed by 
the Senate by a voice vote. As under secretary, Mr. Krebs 
oversees NPPD's efforts to defend civilian networks, secure 
Federal facilities, manage systemic risk to National critical 
functions, and work with stakeholders to raise the security 
baseline of the Nation's cyber and physical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="859" speaker="Chairman McCaul">This is his second tour working at DHS, previously serving 
as a senior advisor to the assistant secretary for 
infrastructure protection and playing a formative role in a 
number of National and international risk management programs. 
I appreciate your leadership in both the private and the public 
sectors, sir. Thank you for being here.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="860" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    I now would like to yield to Mr. Langevin from Rhode Island 
to introduce the Rhode Island secretary of state.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Langevin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="861" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you
and Ranking Member Thompson for reaching out to me to 
facilitate inviting Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie 
Gorbea here to the committee for--to hear her testimony and the 
progress she has made in securing election--Rhode Island's 
election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="862" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Before I introduce Secretary Gorbea, I just want to take a 
moment to publicly congratulate Secretary Krebs on his finally 
being confirmed, officially. We had a brief conversation and 
wanted to publicly, again, congratulate you, Secretary. I 
appreciate the on-going relationship and work that you and I 
have done together, and discussions we have had on election and 
cybersecurity, in particular election security. I hope that 
dialog can continue in our working together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="863" speaker="Mr. Langevin">But Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Thompson, very proud, 
today, to be honored--to be able to recognize and welcome 
Nellie Gorbea, Rhode Island's secretary of state, to the panel, 
today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="864" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Secretary Gorbea has helped position the Ocean State as a 
leader in election security. Under her direction, Rhode Island 
replaced all of its two-decades-old voting equipment prior to 
the 2016 election with new paper ballot systems. Following the 
2016 elections, Secretary Gorbea has taken all the steps that 
we need--that we would hope for States to take to better secure 
their elections systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="865" speaker="Mr. Langevin">She has emphasized proper I.T. staffing and training, 
solicited help from the Election Assistance Commission and from 
DHS and proactively exchanged information with peers through 
the Multi-State ISAC, Elections Infrastructure ISAC, and the 
National Association of Secretaries of State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="866" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Now, with the help of Federal grants appropriated by this 
Congress, Secretary Gorbea is directing the overhaul of Rhode 
Island's voter registration database, initiating local level 
grants to increase security and implementing the country's 
second mandatory post-election risk limiting audit process. 
Just as importantly, Secretary Gorbea has implemented reforms 
to increase voter access to the polls in Rhode Island, 
including on-line and automated voter registration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="867" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Secretary Gorbea, thank you for making the trip down from 
Rhode Island to here, today, with us. Thank you for your on-
going efforts to expand Rhode Island's access to the polls, and 
to prevent foreign adversaries' access to the same.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="868" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Mr. Chairman, this is a position that I once held as Rhode 
Island secretary of state. I am very proud and grateful for the 
leadership that Secretary Gorbea has continued to provide and 
has, certainly, exceeded even things that I have accomplished 
when I was there, and I am very proud of what she has done. I 
hope you and all of our colleagues take the opportunity to ask 
the secretary about her successes and how Rhode Island's 
leadership can be a model for other States to follow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="869" speaker="Mr. Langevin">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With that, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="870" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentleman yields back. Thank you,
both, for being here today. Your full written statements will 
appear in the record.</paragraph>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS, UNDER SECRETARY, NATIONAL</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">The Chair now recognizes Under Secretary Krebs for an 
opening statement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">PROTECTION AND PROGRAMS DIRECTORATE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">Under Secretary Krebs. Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member 
Thompson, and Members of the committee, thank you for today's 
opportunity to testify regarding the Department of Homeland 
Security's on-going efforts to assist State and local election 
officials, those who own and operate election systems, with 
improving the resilience of election security across America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">Today's hearing is timely as primary elections are, 
generally, complete. Election officials now have some time to 
reflect and get ready for the November mid-term elections. In 
fact, later this week, our leadership team at DHS will meet 
with election officials as they gather in Philadelphia for 
their National summer conference.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">It is not lost on me that we will discuss defending our 
democratic institutions and the very cradle of democracy, the 
city that birthed this great Nation. The 2018 mid-terms remain 
a potential target for Russian actors, but the intelligence 
community has yet to see any evidence of a robust campaign 
aimed at tampering with our election infrastructure along the 
lines of 2016 or influencing the makeup of the House or Senate 
races.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">The intelligence community, however, continues to see 
Russia using social media flag--false flag personas, 
sympathetic spokesmen, and other means to influence or inflame 
positions on opposite ends of controversial issues. These 
efforts appear to be more focused on dividing rather than 
targeting specific politicians or political candidates. 
Nonetheless, we remain vigilant and any attempt to undermine 
our democracy will be met with consequences. In the mean time, 
we will continue to work with our election partners to 
strengthen the resilience of our election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">As I have traveled across the country during primary 
season, it is clear to me that secretaries of state and other 
election officials are not sitting back; they take 
cybersecurity and security in general seriously. Our mission at 
DHS is to help our stakeholders better understand and manage 
the risks they face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">Through concerted efforts, in part by building 
relationships, establishing trust, and understanding what it is 
that our stakeholders need to manage their risks, we have made 
significant progress over the last year-and-a-half. Working 
with State and local election officials, as well as with 
private-sector partners who support them, we have created 
Government and private-sector councils who, collaboratively, 
work to share information, promote best practices, and develop 
strategies to reduce risk to the Nation's election systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">We have also created the Election Infrastructure 
Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or ISAC, made up of 
over 1,000 members in just under 5 months, including all 50 
States. We are also sponsoring security clearances for multiple 
election officials in each State. We have increased the 
availability and deployment of free technical services.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">We have also offered cybersecurity and physical security 
training and exercises and later this summer, we will have a 3-
day tabletop exercise with all States involved. Our suite of 
services will continue to mature as the requirements identified 
by our election stakeholders mature.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">We understand that the only way to deliver a resilient 
election system is to work, collaboratively, with those 
election--with those officials on the front lines running the 
process. Our work to secure election officials--I am sorry--to 
secure election infrastructure is part of my directorate's 
broader mission to secure all of our Nation's critical 
infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">We are responsible for coordinating the overall Federal 
effort to promote the security and resilience of the Nation's 
critical infrastructure. As we confront--confront threats posed 
by a range of capable adversaries, DHS remains focused on 
ensuring National unity of effort. It is critical that we 
combine the unique expertise of the intelligence community, law 
enforcement, sector-specific agencies, and others, to provide 
an integrated approach to risk management across our Nation's 
critical infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">Rarely is a cyber event sector-specific. Our adversaries 
target systems that are cross-sector and the growing 
interdependencies across sectors demand this integrated 
approach. Accordingly, DHS serves as information and operations 
integrator focused on delivering cross-sector public-private 
risk management strategies to enhance the resilience of our 
Nation's infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS">Before I conclude, I would like to take a moment to thank 
Congress and this committee in particular for legislative 
progress thus far in strengthening DHS's cybersecurity and 
critical infrastructure authorities. Specifically, we strongly 
support final passage of legislation to create the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, SISA, at DHS 
which would rename and reorganize the National Protection and 
Programs Directorate. This change reflects the important work 
we carry out every day to safeguard and secure our critical 
infrastructure.</paragraph>

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Thank you and I look forward to your questions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Prepared Statement of Christopher C. Krebs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">July 11, 2018</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the 
committee, thank you for today's opportunity to testify regarding the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) on-going efforts to assist 
with reducing and mitigating risks to our election infrastructure. DHS 
is eager to share with you the progress we have made to establish 
trust-based partnerships with our Nation's election officials who 
administer our democratic election processes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Safeguarding and securing cyber space is a core homeland security 
mission. DHS is responsible for protecting civilian Federal Government 
networks and collaborating with other Federal agencies, as well as 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, and the private 
sector to defend against cyber threats. We endeavor to enhance cyber 
threat information sharing across the globe to stop cyber incidents 
before they start and help businesses and Government agencies to 
protect their cyber systems and quickly recover should such an attack 
occur. By bringing together all levels of government, the private 
sector, international partners, and the public, we are taking action to 
protect against cybersecurity risks, improve our whole-of-Government 
incident response capabilities, enhance information sharing of best 
practices and cyber threats, and to strengthen resilience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Recognizing that the 2018 U.S. mid-term elections are a potential 
target for malicious cyber activity, DHS is committed to robust 
engagement with State and local election officials, as well as private-
sector entities, to assist them with defining their risk, and providing 
them with information and capabilities that enable them to better 
defend their infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Given the foundational role that elections play in a free and 
democratic society, in January 2017 the Secretary of Homeland Security 
designated election infrastructure as a critical infrastructure 
subsector. Under our system of laws, Federal elections are administered 
by State and local election officials in thousands of jurisdictions 
across the country. These officials manage election infrastructure and 
ensure its security and resilience on a day-to-day basis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">As such, DHS and our Federal partners have formalized the 
prioritization of voluntary cybersecurity assistance for election 
infrastructure similar to that which is provided to a range of other 
critical infrastructure entities, such as financial institutions and 
electric utilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Since 2016, DHS's National Protection and Programs Directorate 
(NPPD) has convened Federal Government and election officials regularly 
to share cybersecurity risk information and to determine an effective 
means of assistance. The Election Infrastructure Subsector (EIS) 
Government Coordinating Council (GCC) has worked to establish goals and 
objectives, including plans for EIS engagement and the establishment of 
a sector-specific plan (SSP). GCC representatives include DHS, the 
Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and 24 State and local election 
officials. Participation in the council is entirely voluntary and does 
not change the fundamental role of State and local jurisdictions in 
overseeing elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">The Department and the EAC worked with election industry 
representatives to launch an industry-led Sector Coordinating Council 
(SCC), a self-organized, self-run, and self-governed council with 
leadership designated by the sector membership. The SCC serves as 
industry's principal entity for coordinating with the Government on 
critical infrastructure security activities and issues related to 
sector-specific strategies and policies. This collaboration is 
conducted under DHS's authority to provide a forum in which Government 
and private-sector entities can jointly engage in a broad spectrum of 
activities to coordinate critical infrastructure security and 
resilience efforts which is used in each of the critical infrastructure 
sectors established under Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical 
Infrastructure Security and Resilience. The process is a well-tested 
mechanism across critical infrastructure sectors for sharing threat 
information among the Federal Government and critical infrastructure 
partners, advancing risk management efforts, and prioritizing services 
available to sector partners in a trusted environment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">NPPD also engages directly with election officials--coordinating 
requests for assistance, risk mitigation, information sharing, and 
incident coordination, resources, and services. In order to ensure a 
coordinated approach from the Federal Government, NPPD has convened 
stakeholders from across the Federal Government through an Election 
Task Force. The task force serves to provide actionable information and 
offer assistance to assist election officials with strengthening their 
election infrastructure by reducing and mitigating cyber risk, and 
increasing resilience of their processes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Within the context of today's hearing, I will address the 
unclassified assessment of malicious cyber operations directed against 
U.S. election infrastructure and our efforts to help enhance the 
security of elections that are administered by jurisdictions around the 
country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">enhancing security for future elections</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">DHS regularly coordinates with the intelligence community and law 
enforcement partners on potential threats to the homeland. Among non-
Federal partners, DHS has been engaging State and local officials, as 
well as relevant private-sector entities, to assess the scale and scope 
of malicious cyber activity potentially targeting the U.S. election 
infrastructure. Election infrastructure includes the information and 
communications technology, capabilities, physical assets, and 
technologies that enable the registration and validation of voters; the 
casting, transmission, tabulation, and reporting of votes; and the 
certification, auditing, and verification of elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">DHS is committed to ensuring a coordinated response from DHS and 
its Federal partners to plan for, prepare for, and mitigate risk to 
election infrastructure. We understand that working with election 
infrastructure stakeholders is essential to ensuring a more secure 
election. DHS and our stakeholders are increasing awareness of 
potential vulnerabilities and providing capabilities to enhance the 
security of U.S. election infrastructure as well as that of our 
democratic allies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Election officials across the country have a long-standing history 
of working both individually and collectively to reduce risks and 
ensure the integrity of their elections. In partnering with these 
officials through both new and on-going engagements, DHS is working to 
provide value-added--yet voluntary--services to support their efforts 
to secure elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Improving Coordination with State, local, Tribal, Territorial 
(SLTT) and private-sector partners.--Increasingly, the Nation's 
election infrastructure leverages information technology (IT) for 
efficiency and convenience, but also exposes systems to cybersecurity 
risks, just like in any other enterprise environment. Just like with 
other sectors, NPPD helps stakeholders in Federal departments and 
agencies, SLTT governments, and the private sector to manage these 
cybersecurity risks. Consistent with our long-standing partnerships 
with State and local governments, we have been working with election 
officials to share information about cybersecurity risks, and to 
provide voluntary resources and technical assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center 
(NCCIC) works with the MS-ISAC to provide threat and vulnerability 
information to State and local officials. For nearly a decade, DHS has 
funded the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-
ISAC), which has since created the EI-ISAC, to enable its members to 
share cybersecurity information and collaborate with each other. The 
EI-ISAC's membership includes almost 1,000 SLTT election-specific 
entities. Through the MS-ISAC, it has representatives co-located with 
the NCCIC to enable regular collaboration and access to information and 
services for State chief information officers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Providing Technical Assistance and Sharing Information. NPPD 
actively promotes a range of services including:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Cyber hygiene service for internet-facing systems.--Through this 
automated, remote scan, NPPD may provide a report identifying 
vulnerabilities and mitigation recommendations to improve the 
cybersecurity of systems connected to the internet, such as on-line 
voter registration systems, election night reporting systems, and other 
internet-connected election management systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Risk and vulnerability assessments.--We have prioritized State and 
local election systems upon request, and increased the availability of 
risk and vulnerability assessments (RVAs). These in-depth, on-site 
evaluations include a system-wide understanding of vulnerabilities, 
focused on both internal and external systems. We provide a full report 
of vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations following the testing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Incident response assistance.--We encourage election officials to 
report suspected malicious cyber activity to the NCCIC. Upon request, 
the NCCIC can provide assistance in identifying and remediating a cyber 
incident. Information reported to the NCCIC is also critical to the 
Federal Government's ability to broadly assess malicious attempts to 
infiltrate election systems. This technical information will also be 
shared with other State officials so they have the ability to defend 
their own systems from similar malicious activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Knowing what to do when a security incident happens--whether 
physical or cyber--before it happens, is critical. NPPD supports 
election officials with incident response planning including 
participating in exercises and reviewing incident response playbooks. 
Crisis communications are a core component of these efforts, ensuring 
officials are able to communicate transparently and authoritatively to 
their constituents when an incident unfolds. In some cases, we do this 
directly with State and local jurisdictions. In others, we partner with 
outside organizations. We recognize that securing our Nation's systems 
is a shared responsibility, and we are leveraging partnerships to 
advance that mission.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Information sharing.--NPPD maintains numerous platforms and 
services to share relevant information on cyber incidents. State 
election officials may also receive information directly from the 
NCCIC. The NCCIC also works with the EI-ISAC, which allows election 
officials to connect with the EI-ISAC or their State chief information 
officer to rapidly receive information they can use to protect their 
systems. Best practices, cyber threat information, and technical 
indicators, some of which had been previously Classified, have been 
shared with election officials in thousands of State and local 
jurisdictions. In all cases, the information sharing and/or use of such 
cybersecurity risk indicators, or information related to cybersecurity 
risks and incidents complies with applicable lawful restrictions on its 
collection and use and with DHS policies protective of privacy and 
civil liberties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Classified information sharing.--To most effectively share 
information with all of our partners--not just those with security 
clearances--we work with the intelligence community to rapidly 
declassify relevant intelligence or provide tearlines. While DHS 
prioritizes declassifying information to the extent possible, we also 
provide Classified information to cleared stakeholders, as appropriate. 
DHS has been working with State chief election officials and additional 
election staff in each State to provide them with security clearances. 
By working with ODNI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in 
February 2018 election officials from each State received 1-day read-
ins for a Classified threat briefing while they were in Washington, DC. 
This briefing demonstrated our commitment to ensuring election 
officials have the information they need to understand the threats they 
face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Field-based cybersecurity advisors and protective security 
advisors.--NPPD has more than 130 cybersecurity and protective security 
personnel available to provide actionable information and connect 
election officials to a range of tools and resources to improve the 
cybersecurity preparedness of election systems; and to secure the 
physical site security of voting machine storage and polling places. 
These advisors are also available to assist with planning and incident 
management for both cyber and physical incidents.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Physical and protective security tools, training, and resources.--
NPPD provides guidance and tools to improve the security of polling 
sites and other physical election infrastructure. This guidance can be 
found at www.dhs.gov/hometown-security. This guidance helps to train 
administrative and volunteer staff on identifying and reporting 
suspicious activities, active-shooter scenarios, and what to do if they 
suspect an improvised explosive device.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">election security efforts moving forward</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">DHS has made tremendous strides and is committed to working 
collaboratively with those on the front lines of administering our 
elections to secure election infrastructure from risks. The 
establishment of Government and sector-coordinating councils will build 
the foundations for this enduring partnership not only in 2018, but for 
future elections as well. We will remain transparent as well as agile 
in combating and securing our physical and cyber infrastructure. 
However, we recognize that there are significant technology needs 
across SLTT governments, and State and local election systems, in 
particular. It will take significant and continual investment to ensure 
that election systems across the Nation are upgraded and secure, with 
vulnerable systems retired. These efforts require a whole-of-Government 
approach. The President and this administration are committed to 
addressing these risks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">There is a fundamental link between public trust in our election 
infrastructure and the confidence the American public places in basic 
democratic functions. Ensuring the security of our electoral process is 
a vital National interest and one of our highest priorities. Our voting 
infrastructure is diverse, subject to local control, and has many 
checks and balances. As the threat environment evolves, we will 
continue to work with Federal agencies, State and local partners, and 
private-sector entities to enhance our understanding of the threat; and 
to make essential physical and cybersecurity tools and resources 
available to the public and private sectors to increase security and 
resiliency.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">national risk management</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">In addition to addressing election security, we coordinate the 
overall Federal effort to promote the security and resilience of the 
Nation's critical infrastructure, and is responsible for administering 
the implementation of Federal Government cybersecurity policies and 
practices. Cyber threats remain one of the most significant strategic 
risks for the United States, threatening our National security, 
economic prosperity, and public health and safety. We have long been 
confronted with myriad attacks against our digital networks. Americans 
have seen advanced persistent threat actors, including hackers, cyber 
criminals, and nation-states, increase the frequency and sophistication 
of these attacks. Our adversaries have been developing and using 
advanced cyber capabilities to undermine critical infrastructure, 
target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our National security 
secrets, and threaten our democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Global cyber incidents, such as the ``WannaCry'' ransomware 
incident and the ``NotPetya'' malware incident in May and June 2017, 
respectively, are examples of malicious actors leveraging cyber space 
to create disruptive effects and cause economic loss. These incidents 
exploited known vulnerabilities in software commonly used across the 
globe. Prior to these events, NPPD had already taken actions to help 
protect networks from similar types of attacks. Through requested 
vulnerability scanning, we helped stakeholders identify vulnerabilities 
on their networks so they could be patched before incidents and attacks 
occur. Recognizing that not all users are able to install patches 
immediately, we shared additional mitigation guidance to assist network 
defenders. As the incidents unfolded, we led the Federal Government's 
incident response efforts, working with our interagency partners, 
including providing situational awareness, information sharing, malware 
analysis, and technical assistance to affected entities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">In a series of incidents since at least May of last year, working 
with U.S. and international partners, DHS and FBI have identified 
Russian government actors targeting Government entities and businesses 
in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing 
sectors. DHS assesses that this campaign ultimately collected 
information pertaining to industrial control systems with the intent to 
gain access to industrial control systems environments. The intrusions 
have been comprised of two distinct categories of victims: Staging and 
intended targets. In other words, through the Department's incident 
response actions, we have observed this advanced persistent threat 
actor target certain entities that then become pivot points, leveraging 
existing relationships between the initial victim and the intended 
targets to hide their activity, as part of a multi-stage intrusion 
campaign to gain access to networks of major, high-value assets that 
operate components of our Nation's critical infrastructure. Based on 
our analysis and observed indicators of compromise, DHS has confidence 
that this campaign is still on-going, and threat actors are actively 
pursuing their ultimate long-term campaign objectives. DHS and the FBI 
have published a joint technical alert to enable network defenders to 
identify and take action to reduce exposure to this malicious activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">cybersecurity priorities</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">This administration has prioritized protecting and defending our 
public and economic safety from the range of threats that exist today, 
including those emanating from cyber space. Last year, the President 
signed Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of 
Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. This Executive Order set 
in motion a series of assessments and deliverables to understand how to 
improve our defenses and lower our risk to cyber threats. This order 
also emphasized the importance of accountability--clarifying that 
Department and agency heads are responsible and will be held 
accountable for the security of their networks and systems. NPPD plays 
an important role in providing capabilities, services, and direction to 
Federal agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Across the Federal Government, agencies have been implementing 
action plans to use the industry-standard National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. Agencies are 
reporting to DHS and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on their 
cybersecurity risk mitigation and acceptance choices. In coordination 
with OMB, DHS is evaluating the totality of these Agency reports in 
order to comprehensively assess the adequacy of the Federal 
Government's overall cybersecurity risk management posture.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">Although Federal agencies have primary responsibility for their own 
cybersecurity, DHS provides a common set of security tools that helps 
agencies manage their cyber risk. NPPD's assistance to Federal agencies 
includes: (1) Providing tools to safeguard civilian Executive branch 
networks through the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS), 
which includes ``EINSTEIN'' and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation 
(CDM) programs, (2) measuring and motivating agencies to implement 
policies, directives, standards, and guidelines, (3) serving as a hub 
for information sharing and incident reporting, and (4) providing 
operational and technical assistance, including threat information 
dissemination and risk and vulnerability assessments, as well as 
incident response services. The NCCIC is the civilian government's hub 
for cybersecurity information sharing, asset incident response, and 
coordination for both critical infrastructure and the Federal 
Government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">DHS conducts a number of activities to measure agencies' 
cybersecurity practices and works with agencies to improve risk 
management practices. The Federal Information Security Modernization 
Act of 2014 (FISMA) provided the Secretary of Homeland Security with 
the authority to develop and oversee implementation of Binding 
Operational Directives (BOD) to agencies. In May 2018, the Secretary 
issued a BOD to update a previous BOD related to securing High-Value 
Assets--those assets, Federal information systems, information, and 
data for which unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, 
modification, or destruction could cause a significant impact to U.S. 
National security interests, foreign relations, the economy, or to the 
public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the 
American people.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">NPPD works with interagency partners to prioritize High-Value 
Assets for assessment and remediation activities across the Federal 
Government. For instance, we conduct security architecture reviews on 
these High-Value Assets to help agencies assess their network 
architecture and configurations. The updated BOD enhances NPPD's 
approach to conducting these engagements to provide agencies with 
improved results and finding by expanding system scope, refining 
assessment methodologies, and using less-constratined penetration 
testing approaches to resemble tactics, techniques, and procedures used 
by advanced threat actors attempting to gain unauthorized access.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">As part of the effort to secure High-Value Assets, DHS conducts in-
depth vulnerability assessments of prioritized agency these assets to 
determine how an adversary could penetrate a system, move around an 
agency's network to access sensitive data, and exfiltrate such data 
without being detected. These assessments include services such as 
penetration testing, wireless security analysis, and ``phishing'' 
evaluations in which DHS hackers send emails to agency personnel and 
test whether recipients click on potentially malicious links. DHS has 
focused these assessments on Federal systems that may be of particular 
interest to adversaries or support uniquely significant data or 
services. These assessments provide system owners with recommendations 
to address identified vulnerabilities. DHS provides these same 
assessments, on a voluntary basis upon request, to private-sector and 
State, local, territorial, and Tribal partners. DHS also works with the 
General Services Administration to ensure that contractors can provide 
assessments that align with our HVA initiative to agencies.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">In addition to efforts to protect Government networks, Executive 
Order 13800 requires continued examination of how the Federal 
Government and industry work together to protect our Nation's critical 
infrastructure, prioritizing deeper, more collaborative public-private 
partnerships in threat assessment, detection, protection, and 
mitigation. In collaboration with civilian, defense, and intelligence 
agencies, we have worked to identify authorities and capabilities that 
agencies could employ, soliciting input from the private sector, and 
developed recommendations to support the cybersecurity efforts of those 
critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk of attacks that could 
result in catastrophic impacts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">As part of this effort, DHS is establishing a program office to 
strengthen support to such entities and improve coordination of 
interagency support. Through the program office, we will coordinate 
with Federal and non-Federal partners to enhance access to Classified 
information, improve incident communication and coordination, and 
improve cross-sector information sharing, among other efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">conclusion</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">In the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, DHS employees 
stand on the front lines of the Federal Government's efforts to defend 
our Nation's critical infrastructure from natural disasters, terrorism 
and adversarial threats, and technological risk such as those caused by 
cyber threats. Our infrastructure environment today is complex and 
dynamic with interdependencies that add to the challenge of securing 
and making it more resilient. Technological advances have introduced 
the ``Internet of Things'' and cloud computing, offering increased 
access and streamlined efficiencies, while increasing our footprint of 
access points that could be leveraged by adversaries to gain 
unauthorized access to networks. As our Nation continues to evolve and 
new threats emerge, we must integrate cyber and physical risk in order 
to understand how to effectively secure it. Expertise around cyber-
physical risk and cross-sector critical infrastructure 
interdependencies is where NPPD brings unique expertise and 
capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">We must ensure that NPPD is appropriately organized to address 
cybersecurity threats both now and in the future, and we appreciate 
this committee's leadership in working to establish the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency. As the committee considers these 
issues, we are committed to working with Congress to ensure that this 
effort is done in a way that cultivates a safer, more secure, and 
resilient homeland.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Secretary Krebs ">    Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the committee today, 
and I look forward to your questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Thank you under secretary and I look
forward to working with you to make sure the Senate passes 
SISA. I think it is important not only to protecting all 16 
critical infrastructures but also our election system.</paragraph>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF NELLIE M. GORBEA, SECRETARY OF STATE, STATE OFRHODE ISLAND</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="NELLIE M. GORBEA">    Chair now recognizes the Secretary of State Gorbea for an 
opening statement. Do you have a microphone?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Good morning and thank you, Chairman McCaul,
Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the committee for the 
invitation to participate in this important discussion. I 
commend your committee for holding this hearing to learn more 
about what is being done at the Federal, State, and local 
levels to protect our Nation's election systems and what can be 
done to improve upon this work.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Advances in technology have brought with them a paradigm 
shift in elections administration. Cybersecurity is at the 
forefront of elections conversations taking place right now at 
every level of government across the country. But before I 
continue, I want to recognize and thank Congressman Jim 
Langevin for his visionary leadership in elections 
administration and his past service as Rhode Island's Secretary 
of State and whose shoulders I definitely stand on as I do the 
work I do today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Today Rhode Island, and almost all other States, face new 
challenges that can be summarized as follows.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">First, although this is not currently the case in Rhode 
Island, many elections across our country are being run on 
equipment that is either obsolete or near the end of its useful 
life; second, our public-sector employees and systems of the 
State, county, and municipal levels, are ill-prepared to handle 
the looming threats of cyber attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Finally, our country is facing a very real threat by 
foreign actors and others looking to erode the public's trust 
in the integrity of our elections. These attacks are real and 
are focused on undermining our representative democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">On behalf of my colleagues who oversee elections across the 
country, I do want to thank you for the $380 million in 
additional Help America Vote Act funds. However, the challenges 
our democracy faces today require an on-going commitment of 
funding so election officials can prepare for threats that were 
nonexistent 5 years ago.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">As these threats involve funding, training and improved 
communications are critical to protecting our democracy. This 
funding should be flexible. After all, actions addressing this 
new landscape of elections and cybersecurity have taken place 
in a variety of ways because elections are organized and run 
differently in every State.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Having said that, I do believe that our efforts in Rhode 
Island over the past 3 years, offer valuable insight into the 
challenges and opportunities that election officials face in 
this area of increased cyber threats; so, how has Rhode Island 
handled these three challenges I described?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">First, we replaced outdated voting equipment which was on 
the brink of failure. We invested nearly $10 million in new 
paper-based elections equipment that has four layers of 
security and encryption. Federal assistance was important 
throughout all of this process; the election assistance 
commission helped us for example with the RFVs for that 
equipment. While modernizing the electoral process and 
infrastructure, we also leveraged resources offered by the 
Department of Homeland Security under the Critical 
Infrastructure Designation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">We further protected our central voter registration system. 
For example, recently the Department of Homeland Security 
performed external penetration testing and vulnerability 
scanning to assess any cybersecurity concerns with regards to 
our voter registration system. This risk and vulnerability 
assessment provided my office with areas that needed to be 
improved upon to ensure our system is as secure as possible. We 
also looked to the Rhode Island National Guard to provide us 
with a security analysis of newly-purchased electronic poll 
books during a recent special election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Our second challenge is one of building the capacity of the 
public sector to manage and respond to cyber threats and in our 
elections. Some of those services can be outsourced. However, 
we need to make sure that Government owns the ability to 
protect our democracy. In Rhode Island I have increased my 
office's I.T. staff by 40 percent to make sure that we have the 
technical expertise in-house to respond to ever shifting 
landscape of cybersecurity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Our work recently received additional help from the Federal 
level. Working with the National Association of Secretaries of 
State, the Department of Homeland Security provided--initiated 
a process for providing two State election officials, like 
myself, with the required security clearance and this has been 
really helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">At this time I do want to also add my congratulations to 
Under Secretary Krebs for his appointment, and I also want to 
recognize the hire at DHS of former Election Assistance 
Commissioner Chairman, Matt Masterson. I believe that really 
strengthens the operations and the ability of DHS to work with 
the States on cybersecurity and elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">But building the strength of our election system at the 
State level addresses only part of what is needed. Local 
election officials are literally on the front lines and must 
have the information or resources necessary to identify and 
mitigate the emerging threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">For this reason, in Rhode Island, we are members of the 
Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis 
Center, the EI-ISAC. Soon all cities and towns in Rhode Island 
will be signed up with EI-ISAC which provides election 
officials with cybersecurity resources as well as best 
practices that enhance the overall strength of election 
systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">As cyber threats continue to evolve and become more 
sophisticated, States need additional funding and resources 
dedicated to the security of election. These funds have been 
critically needed for strengthening the I.T. capacity within 
Government, developing testing procedures, and undergoing 
third-party assessments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Our amount of $3 million is being used to invest in our 
central voter registration database, strengthening of that 
system and--as well as protecting it, and other large portions 
can help us develop our first-ever post-election audit systems 
in Rhode Island. Finally keeping in mind what I said about 
local government, we are to be using part of the $3 million to 
initiate an election assistance--elections administration 
improvement grant program for cities and towns.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">In conclusion, I want to make the following suggestions. 
First, Congress should provide on-going funding to the States 
so that we remain prepared to face any cybersecurity challenge. 
Second, Federal agencies must continue to provide information, 
training, and resources to support the work being done to 
protect our election systems on a State, county, and local 
level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Congress can help us by formalizing clear communication 
channels between the levels of government so that we know what 
to expect in the communication of cybersecurity. Finally, 
Congress must also continue to provide active oversight in this 
area that now recognizes the new balance that must be struck 
between the secrecy required for security measures needed to 
safeguard our democracy at the same time as we balance it with 
a transparency and access to information that ensure an open 
government.</paragraph>
    <opening>[The prepared statement of Ms. Gorbea follows:]</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Thank you very much for the opportunity to share my 
thoughts with you on this and my experiences as Rhode Island's 
secretary of state; I look forward to continuing our 
conversation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Prepared Statement of Nellie M. Gorbea</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">July 11, 2018</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Thank you, Chairman McCaul and Members of the committee, for the 
invitation to participate in this important discussion of how to best 
address cyber threats to our elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">I commend your committee for holding this hearing to learn more 
about what is being done on the Federal, State, and local levels to 
protect our Nation's elections systems and what can be done to improve 
upon this work. The advances in technology have brought with them a 
paradigm shift in elections administration. Addressing cybersecurity in 
elections has become an urgent and relevant matter. Cybersecurity is at 
the forefront of elections conversations taking place right now at 
every level of government across the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Before I continue, I want to recognize my Congressman, Jim 
Langevin, for his visionary leadership in elections administration in 
his past service as Rhode Island's Secretary of State. Two decades ago, 
then-Secretary Langevin led Rhode Island's early adoption of voting 
technology that replaced the ancient mechanical Shoup Lever voting 
machines with paper-based optical scanners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">In Rhode Island, we are proud of our role as an innovator in 
elections technology. In 1936, for example, Rhode Island was the first 
State to use voting machines at every polling place across the State, 
not just in major cities, as had been the practice at that time across 
the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">As Secretary of State, I am building on that legacy of innovation 
and excellence despite the significant challenges that my State and 
almost all other States face. These challenges can be summarized as 
follows:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">1. First, although this is not currently the case in Rhode Island,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">many elections across our country are being run on equipment</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">that is either obsolete or near the end of its useful life.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">2. Second, our public-sector employees and systems at the State,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">county, and municipal levels are ill-prepared to handle the</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">looming threat of cyber attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">3. Finally, our country is facing a very real threat presented by</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">foreign actors and others who are conducting activities that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">serve to erode the public's trust in the integrity of our</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">elections. These attacks are real and are focused on</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">undermining our representative democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Congress recently took an important step to help us address these 
challenges by providing $380 million for elections administration and 
security in additional Help America Vote Act (HAVA) funds in the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act. On behalf of my colleagues who oversee 
elections across the country I thank you for this important investment. 
I also want to emphasize that the challenges our democracy faces 
require an on-going commitment of funds. Elections officials today, are 
tasked with preparing for threats that were nonexistent 5 years ago and 
are continuously evolving. Funds, training, and improved communication 
are critical to ensuring that we continue to protect our democracy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Actions addressing this new landscape of elections and 
cybersecurity have taken place in a variety of ways because elections 
are organized and run differently in every State. Nonetheless, I 
believe that our efforts in Rhode Island over the past 3 years offer 
valuable insight into the challenges and opportunities that elections 
officials face in this era of increased cyber threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">In Rhode Island, while I serve as chief State election official 
under HAVA, elections are run in coordination and collaboration between 
my office, the Rhode Island State Board of Elections, and local 
elections officials with their boards of canvassers. My office, the 
Department of State, maintains the Central Voter Registration System 
(CVRS), a voter registration database and elections management system 
used by all local elections officials that was developed thanks to HAVA 
funding during Secretary of State Matthew A. Brown's administration. A 
separate agency, the Rhode Island State Board of Elections, oversees 
Election Day operations, is responsible for the security of the voting 
equipment and handles post-election disputes and audits. Meanwhile, 
local elections officials and their boards of canvassers run the polls 
on Election Day.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Our collaboration is a key ingredient to successfully running 
elections. Over the past year, we have strengthened relationships with 
our Federal partners, specifically the Election Assistance Commission 
(EAC) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We have also taken 
advantage of State resources such as the cyber unit at the Rhode Island 
National Guard and the expertise of faculty members at Salve Regina 
University and Brown University.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">So how has Rhode Island handled the three challenges I described 
above?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">First, we addressed the topic of equipment. When I took office in 
2015, our voting equipment, purchased in 1997, was on the brink of 
total failure. Thankfully, when I confronted them with the problem, the 
leadership of our State took this issue seriously--Speaker Nicholas 
Mattiello, then Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed and the membership 
of the General Assembly, along with Governor Gina Raimondo, all 
supported the purchase of new paper-ballot optical scanning machines. 
This translated into an investment of nearly $10 million over the next 
7 years. The EAC was instrumental in providing us with key advice and 
counsel in the development of the Request for Proposals for the new 
voting equipment. Because of these efforts Rhode Island entered the 
2016 election cycle with new, secure voting machines that have four 
layers of security and encryption.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">We have also modernized many other aspects of the electoral process 
and infrastructure. Over the past 2 years we have implemented on-line 
voter registration, acquired electronic poll books, and recently 
implemented automated voter registration. These advancements make both 
voting and the administration of elections more efficient for all 
involved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">While modernizing the electoral process and infrastructure, we also 
leveraged resources offered by the Department of Homeland Security 
under their critical infrastructure designation, to further protect our 
Central Voter Registration System. Recently, DHS performed external 
penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to assess any 
cybersecurity concerns with regard to our voter registration system. 
This Risk and Vulnerability Assessment provided my office with areas 
that needed to be improved to ensure our system is as secure as 
possible. In addition, the Rhode Island National Guard provided a 
security analysis of the electronic poll books (e-poll books), used 
during a recent election, to assess possible security vulnerabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">But investments in hardware and software cannot be used effectively 
if government does not have the human resources that can manage and 
operate them. Our second challenge is one of building the capacity of 
the public sector to manage and respond to cyber threats in our 
elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">In Rhode Island, I have increased my office's IT staff by 40 
percent to ensure that we have the technical expertise in-house 
necessary to respond to the ever-shifting landscape that technology 
presents. This investment in our State workforce has also allowed us to 
deploy on-line tools and resources that not only make our elections 
infrastructure more secure, they make it easier for voters to 
participate in elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">It is important to note that security breaches can come through any 
connection within a governmental office, even those that may be 
physically removed from elections-related infrastructure. That is why 
over the past year we have conducted social engineering training, where 
our own IT team sends phishing emails to employees to test their 
awareness of potentially harmful emails. In addition, all our employees 
participated in cybersecurity awareness and threat mitigation training. 
These tools teach employees about the dangers of methods that on-line 
hackers commonly use to attempt to infect our network.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">However, having technically proficient State and local technology 
professionals is not enough if we do not have a well-developed 
communications structure between DHS and our country's chief State 
election officials. Being able to quickly disseminate information on 
potential threats and respond effectively is critical to safeguarding 
our elections. The National Association of Secretaries of State was 
able to persuasively present this issue to the Department of Homeland 
Security and, as a result, DHS initiated the process of providing chief 
State election officials like myself with the required security 
clearance to effectively manage the cybersecurity of elections systems. 
While this process of communicating cyberthreat information between DHS 
and chief State election officials was admittedly rocky at first, it is 
now much improved and will be an important mechanism to share cyber 
threat information. At this time, I would like to commend DHS for 
bringing on former EAC Chairman Matt Masterson to work with States on 
cybersecurity issues. In my experience working with former Chairman 
Masterson I have found him to be a consummate professional, and his 
thorough knowledge of our country's complex elections systems gives DHS 
critically important knowledge for more effective policy making.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Additionally, local elections officials are on the front lines and 
must have the information and resources necessary to identify and 
mitigate emerging threats. For this reason, in Rhode Island we are 
members of the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-
ISAC) and the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis 
Center (EI-ISAC). In addition, by the end of next week I expect all our 
cities and towns to be signed-up with EI-ISAC. These organizations 
provide elections officials with cybersecurity products and services as 
well as best practices that enhance the overall strength of our 
election systems. For example, the Albert sensor is a device provided 
by MS-ISAC that monitors and analyzes all traffic that comes into our 
network. The information it collects is scanned and if something 
malicious is detected, we are notified.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">In Rhode Island, we are also taking steps of our own to ensure full 
preparedness. Last month, my office and the State Board of Elections 
hosted a seminar for local elections officials that included a 
comprehensive tabletop exercise presenting potential scenarios on 
Election Day. Elections officials were forced to make quick decisions 
under pressure and practice how to handle such situations. The exercise 
was based on a similar program my team attended at Harvard University's 
Belfer Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Last year, I convened more than a hundred of Rhode Island's local 
elections officials and IT staff for a summit on elections 
cybersecurity. Several industry and academic experts in the field of 
cybersecurity, as well as Congressman Langevin, provided briefings 
during the summit. One important message that we focused on that day 
with local elections officials is that cybersecurity is not a 
destination; it is a continuous process of assessment, improvement of 
our systems, and mitigation of risk.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">This is why we must bring together all stakeholders, regardless of 
political affiliations, to continually identify threats and work on 
solutions. This is not a far-fetched ideal. In fact, IT leaders from 
Google and Facebook have commented that the top technology companies in 
our country regularly collaborate on cyberthreat information facing 
their companies despite being fierce competitors. We must develop a 
similar protocol in the public sector to share information on cyber 
threats. In Rhode Island, I have focused on ensuring that our elections 
officials and staff at every level have the information necessary to 
minimize cybersecurity threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Investment in training of our public-sector employees has become a 
critical need. As cyber threats continue to evolve and become more 
sophisticated, States need additional funding and resources dedicated 
to the security of elections systems. These funds are necessary for 
third-party assessments, testing procedures, and strengthening IT 
capacity. The HAVA funds approved by Congress in the recently-passed 
Appropriations Act are an important initial investment in such systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Using Rhode Island as an example, I would like to take a minute to 
discuss some of the critical initiatives that we are investing in with 
the new HAVA funds.
  &lt;bullet&gt; One of our key priorities is to secure the registry of</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">voters. Prior to the 2018 election we plan to invest over</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">$500,000 in cybersecurity enhancements to our CVRS.
  &lt;bullet&gt; The new funds also enable us to rewrite our CVRS</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">application, originally developed in 2004 and 2005, to current</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">industry best-practice standards and help us protect against</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">penetration attempts.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Understanding that trust in elections results is critical,</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">we will fund the first-ever post-election audits in Rhode</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Island. This law was passed by our legislature in 2017 and is</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">another step in ensuring the integrity of our elections.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Ensuring that municipalities also improve their systems and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">help protect our elections, we will initiate an Elections</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Administration Improvement Grant Program for cities and towns</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">to make election security enhancements on a local level.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">In conclusion, I would like to make the following suggestions:
  &lt;bullet&gt; Congress can play a critical role by providing on-going</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">funding to the States so that we remain prepared to face any</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">cybersecurity challenge. As I mentioned above, the additional</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">HAVA funds approved earlier this year are welcome and much</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">needed by jurisdictions across the country. However, sustained</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">funding is necessary for elections officials to modernize their</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">systems to enhance the integrity and security of our elections.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Federal agencies must continue to provide important training</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">and resources to support the work being done on a State and</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">local level to protect our elections systems.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Congress also can formalize clear communication channels</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">between Federal agencies and State and local governments to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">share cyber threats and information to assist in preparing for</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">any outside interference in our elections. The Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">Government should recognize that it can play a critical</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">advisory and support role in securing elections infrastructure</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">while respecting the fact that elections are the responsibility</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">of State and local elections officials. It is my firm belief</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">that improving the integrity of elections systems can be</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">achieved while simultaneously improving access to voting.
  &lt;bullet&gt; Finally, Congress must also provide oversight of Federal</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">intelligence and security agencies recognizing the important</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">balance that must be kept between security measures needed to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">safeguard our democracy and the transparency and access to</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">information that preserve our ability to have open government</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">and elections that can be trusted.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Ms. Gorbea ">    Thank you again for the opportunity to present testimony on the 
work we are doing in Rhode Island and how the Federal Government can 
work with States to ensure our Nation's elections systems are secure 
and our democracy safeguarded.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Thank you, Secretary.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. In 
October 2016, the Ranking Member and I sat in what is called a 
Gang of Eight briefing with the DNI Director Clapper and 
Secretary of Homeland Jeh Johnson.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We were briefed at that time, in a Classified setting. 
Since then, the information has been made public that Russia 
was attempting to meddle in our elections using a campaign and 
information warfare model. I would--I would have to say it was 
very disturbing. I think I speak for the Ranking Member, as 
well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I urged, then at that time, that--the previous 
administration to call out Russia for what they were doing and 
that there should be consequences to their actions. I have also 
said the same thing to this administration that Russia needs to 
be called out and there should be consequences. Congress passed 
sanctions--harsh sanctions against Russia for their conduct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Chairman McCaul">With that, Mr. Krebs, I want to ask you if you--as we move 
into the 2016--or 2018 mid-term elections, can you tell me what 
the threat level is from foreign adversaries and foreign 
nation-states to potentially meddle in the upcoming elections?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. So, as I mentioned in my opening 
statement, we have not seen anything, certainly, to the degree 
of 2016 in terms of specific hacking of election systems. I 
think at this point it is--it is important to--to distinguish 
or differentiate between directed technical attacks against 
I.T. systems, much like what we saw in 2016 with the--the 
database--the voter registration database is the scanning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Chairman McCaul">That is the cybersecurity technical piece of it. Then, 
there's also an information operations element of it. I think 
that is fairly well-characterized in the intelligence community 
assessment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We are, again, not seeing, on either hand, something that 
rises to--anything that rises from--to the level of 2016 
directed, focused, robust campaign, but we do see continued 
Russian activities. The intelligence community continues to see 
Russian activity in the sowing discord across the American 
public.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    It is not, again, directed, necessarily, at politicians or 
political campaigns, but it is focused on identifying divisive 
issues, and sowing discord, and creating chaos, and, frankly, 
undermining democracy.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So there will be more of this campaign
information or disinformation warfare?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir, that is the way I would 
characterize it. We are seeing more along the lines of 
information operations rather than directed technical attacks 
or anything focusing on elections of, particularly, the mid-
terms.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So, that leads me to the--the
vulnerabilities in the election system itself. You don't see 
any targeted technical attacks toward, say, the voting 
machines?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. In terms of the--just stepping back 
a little bit on the voting machines and I, you now, of course 
would defer to Secretary Gorbea and what she has seen in Rhode 
Island, we are--voting systems in and of themselves are systems 
of systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So, we have the voting day which is what people, typically, 
think of with e-poll books and optical scanning machines or the 
DREs. Then, you have a broader system that supports the 
backend, the information management systems that store voter 
registration. Just like any I.T. system, there--there are going 
to be vulnerabilities just by the very nature of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Chairman McCaul">There are a series of compensating controls even on DREs 
that can limit risk. Ultimately, what we are looking for, here, 
is not a 100 percent secure system. Just like any I.T. system, 
there is no such thing as a secure I.T. system. What we are 
looking for is resilience in the system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Chairman McCaul">To think about this, maybe, in a different way is, over the 
course of the last couple of months through primaries, there 
have been a number of issues with I.T. systems and California 
had a voter printout, about 118,000 voters across 1,000 
precincts in L.A. County, and then just recently in Maryland, 
there was an issue with transferring registration information 
from the DMV to the Secretary of State--State's office.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Chairman McCaul">What we are really seeing there more than anything is that, 
yes, there are technical challenges, but the way the system is 
engineered or architected, in part due to work by Congress, and 
HAVA in particular, is that even if you showed up to vote and 
your registration had been, whether accidentally or 
intentionally, deleted from a voter registration file, you have 
the ability to request a provisional ballot.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    So, if, in 2016, when the Russians were in the Illinois 
State registration database, had they deleted voter 
registration files, Illinois citizens would have been able to 
show up. If their information had been deleted, they still 
would have been able to request a provisional ballot. They 
would have cast their ballot; it would have been counted as 
cast. So, this, again, it is not 100 percent security. We are 
looking to achieve resilience in the system.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> Secretary, how resilient do you believe
the--your State's system is?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Our system is actually very resilient and I
share Under Secretary Krebb's description of what we are 
looking for is resilience and not foolproof security. So, we 
have a series of mitigating factors. One is, of course, 
protecting the systems. Each city and town has its own 
structures of how to then transfer that information to the 
central--but what Under Secretary Krebs described is, very 
much, what is happening in Rhode Island today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">In addition, we have been able to leverage resources, not 
just from the Federal level but for our own National Guard so 
that we are constantly testing the security of systems at the 
same time as we, sort-of, think of the what-if. What if 
something happens?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">So, for example, recently we had a mock disaster day with 
all of the clerks in the cities and towns to try to go through 
what happens if you show up on Election Day and you discover 
that there has been some tampering? What would--how would you 
respond?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    We hadn't done that before this year because it hadn't 
really come up. So, you have to get people at the local and 
municipal level to start thinking in this way which goes to my 
point about----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> My time is, kind-of----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> Oh, sorry.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> Expired. But I--let me just say, in terms
of the voting machines themselves, most of them--these machines 
are not connected to the internet now. They are disconnected?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> So, the description of whether or not they are
connected is an interesting one because that, also, has changed 
over time. Most machines are individual and there is a modem 
transmission for some of them, for example, at the end of the 
day, that transmits the results. But there are back-ups to that 
and in the case of Rhode Island, the most important back-up, of 
course, is the paper ballot.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> But everything is always front-based going
back to the premise of my question, you don't see this 
technical threat currently?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> In terms of the voting systems in Rhode Island,
no.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> From a foreign adversary?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> From foreign adversaries, no. I do think that--
I mean we front-loaded our investment into voting machines and 
that made a big difference in our----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Chairman McCaul">And Under Secretary, you and I talked
previously about Members of Congress--how--how safe are we from 
foreign adversary attacks and how--how protected are we on our 
networks?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. So everyone has a different model. I 
think given the sensitivity of the information, the policy 
shaping that this body engages in, I think that it is safe to 
say that a foreign adversary from a pure intelligence 
perspective would probably want to know what you guys are doing 
on a daily basis, what policies you are driving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    In terms of how you are positioned from a security 
perspective, I don't have frankly in-depth knowledge of your 
I.T. systems given the separation of powers but happy to 
provide a briefing on, in part, best practices, but also work 
with the CIO. I think we are doing some engagement on how we 
can collaborate and help Congress secure their networks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I think that would be helpful. I think
most Members have no idea how vulnerable they really are to 
these attacks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    So with that, I recognize the Ranking Member.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Yes, I agree with you because we have been in
some hearings--some briefings who really laid out some kind-of 
scary scenarios. Well, you are--you are official now, Mr. 
Krebs, welcome.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Just from a historical standpoint, how many States have we 
identified that the Russians did some form of intrusion in the 
last elections?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Under Secretary Krebs. So when we think back to 2016, there 
are a couple ways we have to, kind-of, hash out the information 
it is all based on frankly awareness visibility into activity 
and infrastructure. So we have thrown around numbers--18 were 
either accessed or scanned or targeted or 21, whatever it is. 
Last summer we--we gave 21, when I--that number, 21 that were 
scanned, that information is based on the telemetry, the 
visibility into traffic over networks that we had, that, 
frankly, that we had visibility to last year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    If you were to ask me what I really thought happened, I 
would suspect, and Jeannette--Assistant Secretary Manfra said 
this and I believe Secretary Nielsen said this too, I--I would 
suspect that the Russians probably scanned all 50 States and 5 
territories and the District of Columbia. Scanning, it happens 
every day; it is an automated process. I just again, I think 
based on the 21 number, that is not what we were able to see. 
We have better visibility going in to 2018. We basically have--
will have access to close to 50 percent of visible--I am sorry, 
100 percent visibility into at least the State networks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. Thompson">So is that scanning considered a
vulnerability?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Under Secretary Krebs. The scanning is a threat; a 
vulnerability would reside in the system. The scanning is the 
actual foreign adversary's actions to look for vulnerabilities.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. Thompson">So since whether it is 18, 21 or whatever,
how many States have we worked with to identify, help them 
identify potential threats or whatever?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Under Secretary Krebs. So at this point, sir, we are 
working with all 50 States. We have all 50 States as members of 
the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis 
Center. That is since February when we stood up the I-ISAC 
close to 1,000 total members of the I-ISAC at this point, and 
that is 50 States plus local jurisdictions, counties, in 
associations like NAS----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Mr. Thompson">So your testimony is that everybody is
cooperating?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Under Secretary Krebs. There are levels of cooperation. As 
always, everybody has different capabilities of the State level 
and different resourcing as well. But at this moment I can say 
that all 50 States are participating in the I-ISAC.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Explain resourcing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, resourcing would be how they 
are funded at the State level. You know, Secretary Gorbea is 
fortunate to have resources provided by the State treasury that 
she could in 2016, or prior to 2016, replace her outdated 
equipment. Not all States are similarly resourced and that is 
going to be a challenge going forward and I think that is 
probably the greatest opportunity for policy discussion.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. Thompson"> Madam Secretary, you talked to some of your
colleagues around the country I am sure on this. Can you shed a 
little light on the resourcing?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Yes, I can absolutely vouch for the fact that
the equipment is just the tip of the iceberg; it is the one 
that is easy to fix quickly, right? Because you know that it is 
outdated, you know that it is not up to code and you can 
replace it any time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">I think the second layer of resourcing that is really 
important is the public sector rank-and-file people who are 
working in this in Government. We at some point need to invest 
in making sure that the people at the local level--you can have 
fabulous resources at the Federal level at DHS, but if they 
don't have anyone to engage with at the local level on the 
security on what all of this means, then you are--you are 
basically going blind.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    So I think that there's, it is two-piece; one is the 
equipment and the other one is the human resources.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. Thompson">So we talked a little bit about this re-
siloing that is occurring. Give us your opinion about how you 
see that, pro or con, in terms of the cyber, Under Secretary?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Under Secretary Krebs. Thank you for the question. I think 
this one's pretty clear. The Homeland Security Act 2003 
provided the Secretary of Homeland Security very clear 
authorities to lead the critical infrastructure protection 
activities of the--across the Federal Government in 
coordination with sector-specific agencies, the intelligence 
community, and law enforcement.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Mr. Thompson">So I think to the extent that we are creating duplicative, 
whether it is liability protections or information sharing or 
information--integration centers, I think that is having a 
negative effect. It is in some cases it could put us into 
something along the lines of a pre-9/11 position where we don't 
have that integration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    That is why in my opening statement said several times that 
DHS is an information and operations integrator. That is our 
role.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Mr. Thompson">Right. So in other words it would make us
less secure?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Mr. Thompson">    Under Secretary Krebs. That is my belief, yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Thompson</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. Thompson"> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentleman yields back.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    The gentleman from New York, Mr. King, is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. King">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank both witnesses
for testifying here today and Secretary Krebs, I wish you the 
very best and, Secretary Gorbea, thank you for your efforts in 
Rhode Island and for working with my good friend Mr. Langevin.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. King">When we talk about cyber activity by the Russians, today we 
seem to be focusing obviously on the attempts to hack the 
election systems, but also they have distorted information and 
attempted to influence people. What is being done in that and 
who has primary jurisdiction over that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. King">    Under Secretary Krebs. So as I said earlier on, we do look 
at things that the technical hacking and then the information 
operations DHS has lead for supporting State and local 
governments, and the information--or I am sorry--in a hacking 
space. FBI has lead in countering foreign interference and 
the--in the information operations space. DHS does support the 
FBI's efforts as does of course the intelligence community.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Mr. King"> It--do you want to add to that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> No, I--they really do have the best information
on--particularly the information warfare stuff.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Mr. King"> Right, and how's the level of cooperation with
the FBI and DHS in that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">So most recently, we did have a meeting in
February with the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security that 
was incredibly helpful to secretaries of state across the 
country that were altogether for their annual meeting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">That kind of information is--is critical. We can't--part of 
the challenge here with elections is elections are 
decentralized. So--and I think we suffered some, you know, 
beginning stumbling, you know, when all of this came together.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Where a locality was being informed of a potential breach 
or activities, and the chief State election officials who 
happened to be secretaries of state didn't know about it. 
Those--those communication activities between the Federal and 
the local and the State level, I think have smoothed out 
considerably over the last several months as we have learned to 
get along. The other challenge is that as elected officials, we 
deal in the world of transparency and open government.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Mr. King"> Right.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> DHS works in a very different mode. That is
attention that we need to be conscious of and to make sure that 
we make--we accept the adequate provisions for.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Mr. King">We also know that Russia is interfering in
elections throughout Europe, more elections coming up, more 
meddling expected. How much information does DHS share with our 
foreign allies and foreign countries on this and how closely do 
we work with them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Mr. King">Under Secretary Krebs. I--it is difficult to quantify how 
much information we share, but I do know that over the last 
year or so with various campaigns that happened in Europe, 
whether it was France or Germany, we do have cert-to-cert 
relationships, where we can share technical indicators of known 
command-and-control infrastructure of Russian adversaries.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Mr. King">    So we can help them--we will share what we know, they will 
share what they know, so I do feel as if it is a good 
relationship in terms of the engagement.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Mr. King"> As far as Rhode Island, you may have covered this
in your opening statement but how much cooperation is there 
among the States as far as, you know, you sitting down with 
other secretaries of state?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> So the National Association of Secretaries of
State provides an excellent coming together on a bipartisan 
basis so that we can have these conversations about what is 
happening. We have also under that advocacy--or not--group--
bipartisan group have provided a space for our own I.T. 
officials with our rank-and-file civil servants to be able to 
have conversations around security issues and what are best 
practices. Those are critically important in this day and age.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Mr. King"> Without having to name names, are there other
secretaries of state who resist this, who feel that this plot 
is over--you know, threat is overblown?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> No, I don't think that anybody at this point,
well, for the most part, I think everybody agrees that there is 
some level of threat; I think that was made very clear in our 
security briefing afternoon. There are more tensions around 
this issue of the communications with the Federal Government 
and where--and how do we go about finding out what is happening 
in our own States so that we can help proactively address the 
issues at a local level.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. King">Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Mr. King">Secretary, you want to add anything to that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Mr. King">Under Secretary Krebs. I think that is spot-on, as I 
mentioned in my opening, everyone understands that the threat 
is real. The challenge here is, again, goes to the resourcing 
issue. If I provide information, what can be done about it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Mr. King">    To the point of the Classified information and how we 
engage, I aim on a daily basis to operate as much in the 
unclassified space as possible so that the products that I push 
out are immediately actionable by broad communities. So it 
doesn't help me if I am--as Secretary Gorbea pointed out, if I 
am living in a Classified space. That should not be the DHS 
mission space; we should be managing risk in an unclassified 
manner that is informed by threat intelligence.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. King</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Mr. King">Secretary Krebs, Gorbea, thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Mr. King">    I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Gentleman yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    The gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin is 
recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Langevin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
Ranking Member Thompson, and to Secretary Krebs and Secretary 
Gorbea, thank you again for your testimony and all the work 
that you are doing to enhance election security across the 
country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Mr. Krebs, let me start with you. As you know, the 2018 
omnibus provided additional HAVA funding for State election 
officials to better secure their systems in advance of the mid-
terms. Do you believe that the States are using these Federal 
dollars--States using these Federal dollars are making risk-
informed decisions on how to spend them?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Under Secretary Krebs. So I do believe that States are 
using the money in a manner that addresses their threat model, 
their risks scenario. I would not though assume that all that 
money is going to replace out-of-date equipment. There are 
challenges from a procurement perspective; there are also the 
challenge for it is frankly not enough money to transition that 
equipment.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Mr. Langevin">What we have done working with States and informed in part 
by our risk and vulnerability assessments is working with DHS, 
working with EAC and with the Government Coordinating Council--
put together a list of recommended expenditures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Mr. Langevin">So if you have got this money from the omnibus, the $380 
million a year distribution, here are good ways to spend it. 
There are things as simple as hiring what we are calling a 
cyber navigator, someone that actually has cybersecurity 
expertise that can get out from your State capital and go work 
with the various counties.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Because that is the real challenge here, is that when you 
think about across the Nation, there's close to, if not over, 
10,000 jurisdictions and there's not enough cybersecurity 
expertise to go around as it stands, so let's--let's continue 
to invest in that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Mr. Langevin">    But it is also things like training, exercises, response 
planning, patching systems, updating operating systems, things 
like that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Langevin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Mr. Langevin">So the list you mentioned certainly is
helpful because it is broad; it is not specific to their 
systems per se. I guess my--what I would ask, would 
requirements that States conduct risk assessments before using 
the Federal dollars help to ensure maximum efficacy to improve 
their cybersecurity posture?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Under Secretary Krebs. So I think that that is certainly 
something that we would consider, and we of course, offer the 
risk and vulnerability assessments to the States at this point. 
We have conducted about 17 of them; we have another one that is 
in the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Mr. Langevin">But absent the other 31 being completed, or 32 being 
completed, we are taking the lessons learned, the observations 
from those risk and vulnerability assessments, and we are 
sharing those broadly through the ISAC and through our day-to-
day engagement. So for those States that don't--haven't done an 
RVA may not want to do an RVA because they have some other 
capability, we are going ahead and taking the learnings that we 
got from the RVA that Rhode Island did and we are pushing that 
out more broadly.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Mr. Langevin">    Again, that is what informed the recommended expenditures 
or the guidance that we developed with the GCC. So that is a 
good way of--and--and to be clear, that through all of those 
risks and vulnerability assessments we saw pretty much the same 
thing: Out-of-date operating systems, patch management 
challenges, and lack of awareness across staff. These are all 
things that we can address through, initially, through the--the 
HAVA money, but then on-going DHS support.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Langevin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Thank you. I think that some of those things
are very helpful. I think that the requirements for risk 
assessments would be a best way to use the funds, and I will 
mention that--I want to point out to the Chairman that the 
bipartisan PAPER Act that I have introduced with Congressman 
Mark Meadows contains provisions that will require these kinds 
of assessments, so----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Mr. Langevin">    But Secretary Gorbea, in your testimony you spoke about the 
need for continued cybersecurity training of State and local 
election officials. So can you elaborate on the nature of the 
training that is needed, and in particular, about the resources 
you hope DHS can provide?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Yes. Yes, so basically, we are only as strong
as our weakest link. While I have been able to really improve 
the--the cybersecurity at our--in the Department of State, 
truth is, is that elections in Rhode Island are run also at the 
local boards of canvassers, as well as the State Board of 
Elections. So what we have encountered is, once you deal with a 
hardware issue, you have to deal with the people, as well. DHS 
has been particularly helpful in helping us navigate through 
all of that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">I also want to give a shout out, though, to the Election 
Assistance Commission because when we were looking for new 
voting equipment, they were there to help us, also, with best 
practices. I think that is a perfect role for the Federal 
Government with locals. The locals know, the State people know 
where their needs are most pressing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">The training that we have done in Rhode Island involves 
everything from a cyber summit that you participated in about a 
year ago, where we--where we basically walked through, why are 
we having these conversations around cybersecurity? For 
somebody who's a clerk, who's handling everything from fishing 
licenses, to other types of licenses, to voter registration, it 
may not be clear to them why they need to be, you know, 
safeguarding that password for the central voter registration 
system, where they are in--when they are doing, you know, voter 
registrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    So we had a big conversation with the local officials, and 
which we will continuously do every 6 months, and as part of 
every single training that we do out of the Department of State 
to help build that capacity at the local level.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Langevin</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Thank you very much. I know that my time
expired. I want to thank you both for your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Mr. Langevin">Mr. Chairman, I know, as my time is expired, I would like 
to submit this question for the record: On April 24, Assistant 
Secretary Jeanette Manfra testified that the surge in risk and 
vulnerability assessments for election infrastructure created a 
significant backlog in other critical infrastructure sectors 
and Federal agencies waiting for similar assessments. The 
President's 2019 budget did not request an increase in 
resources sufficient to overcome this backlog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Mr. Langevin">So my question would be, are--are more resources necessary 
to support the increased requests from State and local 
governments without delaying other assessments, or do you 
expect RVA backlogs to be the new normal at NPPD? I will submit 
that for the record, since my time is expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Mr. Langevin">    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentleman yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    The gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Rogers, is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Mr. Rogers">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Mr. Rogers">Secretary Krebs, I have been surprised that so many 
Americans have acted shocked that Russia was meddling in our 
election, when they have been meddling in elections all across 
the globe in countries, particularly European countries, and 
most specifically, Eastern European countries that used to be a 
part of the USSR, and they do this primarily through 
disinformation. Many people in America may not realize that 
R.T. is Russia Today, and it is propaganda too.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Mr. Rogers">My question is, since disinformation is their tool of 
choice, or their weapon of choice, in meddling in elections 
across the globe, do you have somebody in your department, or 
is it your department's job to counter this disinformation when 
you find it in our country? If not, what department does have 
that responsibility?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Mr. Rogers">Under Secretary Krebs. So as I mentioned earlier, the way 
we look at it, again, is the technical hacking piece, and then 
there's the information operations, DHS leads the cybersecurity 
working with State and local. FBI leads information operations, 
but DHS does support. So FBI's role working with the 
intelligence community is identifying specific actors, whether 
it is Twitter handles or whatever it is, and disrupting those 
activities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Mr. Rogers">Now, that is only part of the problem, is actually taking 
down the disruptive activity, because frankly, with 
disinformation, the way to counter disinformation is actually 
shine light on the activity. So what we are doing at DHS 
working with others in the State Department Global Engagement 
Center, working with the FBI, is to build a greater 
understanding and awareness of what their activities are, 
engaging social media companies, engaging traditional media and 
sharing our findings, our trends. Here are the things that they 
are doing. How do we raise awareness across the American 
public?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Mr. Rogers">This is one of those cases that it is different from 
traditional cybersecurity, because cybersecurity--elections, 
for instance. What we are aiming for is resilience in the 
system so we can take a lick, and we can keep going forward.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Mr. Rogers">Disinformation's completely different. It is--the objective 
is anti-fragility, and what that means is unlike resilience, 
where you just want to keep moving through it, with anti-
fragility you want to come back stronger; where you learned 
from the experience, or that engagement, we learned in 2016--
that we learned, and we closed out that avenue of influence. 
That is where we are aiming for.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Mr. Rogers">    So we are doing a good bit of trend analysis of how we are 
seeing Russian actors engage through information campaigns 
and--and operations, and looking for opportunities of 
intervention to close out those--those avenues.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="191" speaker="Mr. Rogers">So when you say, ``we,'' are you talking about
just DHS, or----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="192" speaker="Mr. Rogers">Under Secretary Krebs. No, sir. It is, it is a whole--it is 
a cross-government agency. I, in my operation and NPPD, working 
with the Intelligence Analysis Directorate, the Privacy Office, 
the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office of DHS, among 
others, we have established a Countering Foreign Influence Task 
Force, and they--we are looking at some of the--the unique 
authorities the Department has.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="193" speaker="Mr. Rogers">    That works in coordination with the FBI's Foreign Influence 
Task Force, and it is also supported by the intelligence 
community and the State Department; so it is--everybody has a 
role in this, given the unique authorities and the, well, 
frankly, the unique authorities of the various agencies.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="194" speaker="Mr. Rogers">Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="195" speaker="Mr. Rogers">    Secretary Gorbea, you talked about replacing all of your 
voting machines in the State. How much did it cost to do that?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="196" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> $10 million.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="197" speaker="Mr. Rogers"> How much of that was State money?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="198" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> All of it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="199" speaker="Mr. Rogers"> All of it was State money?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="200" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="201" speaker="Mr. Rogers"> No Federal money was used?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="202" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> No Federal money was used.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="203" speaker="Mr. Rogers"> Have you received any Federal money for any
security improvements?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="204" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> Yes. Well, where we will be using the $3
million HAVA funds to continue now to really tackle our central 
voter registration system, which was developed with, actually, 
the first batch of HAVA monies. So that application will be 
rewritten and strengthened.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="205" speaker="Mr. Rogers"> Now, you mentioned earlier in your opening
statement that you needed to make some improvements to your 
central database. What exactly are you talking about?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="206" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> So just for the protections. You know, our--the
focus of our risk vulnerability assessment was actually our 
central voter registration database, to make sure that we 
didn't know of open doors throughout our systems that somebody 
might come in through. So that was----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="207" speaker="Mr. Rogers"> Is it connected to a network?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="208" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> Yes, and--actually I must say we actually now
have trained all of our staff and continue to do on-going 
training to every--whether you are in the archives of the 
secretary of state's office or in business services, is to 
identify phishing e-mails, things like that, so everybody's on 
their toes to not click on something that might compromise our 
elections.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Rogers</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="209" speaker="Mr. Rogers"> Excellent, thank you very much, thank you all
for being here, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="210" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Gentleman yields back, the gentlelady from
New Jersey, Mrs. Watson Coleman is recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="211" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Congratulations to you, Mr. Krebs, and thank you for being 
here, Madam Secretary. I just--I have got a couple of 
questions. Is it possible that Russia could be doing something 
right now that would interfere with this 2018 election and we 
might not know about it yet?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="212" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    Could they possibly be involved some way now, or is it just 
too early?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krebs</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="213" speaker="Mr. Krebs">You know, again, like I mentioned, we haven't
seen anything certainly on the level of 2016, neither on the 
direct hacking. We do know that they are launching--they are 
carrying out generally speaking information operations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="214" speaker="Mr. Krebs">You know, I--this is kind-of one of those, you know, I 
don't know what I don't know right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="215" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Mrs. Watson Coleman. How many months in advance was this 
hacking identified before the 2016? Was it 3 months before, 2 
months before, 5 months before?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="216" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Under Secretary Krebs. That was before my time at the 
Department, I was still in the private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="217" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Mrs. Watson Coleman. Would you know, though, this----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="218" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Under Secretary Krebs. It was over the course of the summer 
I believe prior to the 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="219" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Mrs. Watson Coleman. OK so it is really this summer that we 
need----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="220" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Under Secretary Krebs. It was--you know, I think the real, 
as I recall, the real indicators of activity took place about 
this time July 2016.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="221" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Mrs. Watson Coleman. It is really confusing to me, all of 
the various agencies that are--have a piece of this. So is 
there like a routine meeting that you all have around these 
issues?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="222" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Under Secretary Krebs. So in terms of the cybersecurity 
piece, yes, ma'am. We have developed a government coordinating 
council that brings not just Federal agencies together, but 
also State and local partners.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="223" speaker="Mr. Krebs">So in that, it is a weekly meeting that DHS, the Election 
Assistance Commission, but also, you know, I am of the mind 
that when it is just the Federal Government working together on 
a problem, you are not getting a lot done because the Federal 
Government doesn't always have all the answers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="224" speaker="Mr. Krebs">We need to work with our stakeholders, again, as I said in 
my opening statement, to understand what their requirements are 
so that we can tailor our services to address their needs. That 
is really the mantra that I have instituted across NPPD, it is 
requirements-based.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="225" speaker="Mr. Krebs">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Do you think or even do you think, 
Madam Secretary, based upon your involvement, that all 50 
States are equally concerned, engaged, and willing to 
participate as rigorously as possible to ensure that our 
infrastructure, voting infrastructure is protected, and our 
voters votes are counted?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="226" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">So I cannot speak for all 50 States, I can tell
you that at the National Association of Secretaries of State, 
these issues have been highlighted and discussed more so than I 
ever thought when I was running for secretary of state.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="227" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. Well, like the President still doesn't 
believe that this is happening because Vladimir Putin has told 
him that it hasn't. In your sort-of interactions, are there any 
States that kind of are where the President is on this, that it 
really didn't happen, it is crap, or does everyone recognize 
except for the President that this did happen?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="228" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">I personally have not had any conversations
that--that way.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="229" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Mrs. Watson Coleman. So $38 million has been appropriated 
to help various States protect their systems or do whatever 
they have to do. Does that include money going down into the 
municipalities and the counties to train people, to do the 
audits that need to be done, to replace the equipment that 
needs to be replaced, Mr. Krebs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="230" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Under Secretary Krebs. So the $380 million in the fiscal 
year 2018 omnibus is a broad--is available for a broad set of--
--</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="231" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Mrs. Watson Coleman. But it can--it goes to the States and 
then the States will decide how to spend it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="232" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Under Secretary Krebs. I believe that is correct----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="233" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">That is correct, and it is--there is actually a
fair--while there are guidance and sort-of big buckets of 
categories, it is really allowed--it really allows the chief 
State election official to allocate it in the best way 
possible----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="234" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. So it is been indicated that the 
States have suggested a $380 million, while a lot of money is 
not adequate. Do you have any idea what that number should be, 
from their perspective?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="235" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Not--not off-hand, although I can use Rhode
Island as an example for exempt. So we are receiving $3 
million, our replacement alone, voting systems of the machines, 
was $10 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="236" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. That was purely State money.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="237" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">That is right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="238" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. So if a State doesn't have it, and 
this $380 million could be legitimately used for it, it seems 
like it really could be a lot more depending upon how many 
States have the capacity to do this and want to do it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="239" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Yes, that is correct.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="240" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Mrs. Watson Coleman. OK, thank you, thank you, I yield 
back. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="241" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> The gentlelady yields, the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, Mr. Perry is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="242" speaker="Mr. Perry">Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations,
Secretary, and welcome, Madam Secretary, appreciate your 
presence. I just want to make sure I understand the playing 
field in--in the context that Russia or the USSR in its 
previous version has been involved in the United States and 
undermining the United States since 1917, since the Bolshevik 
revolution.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="243" speaker="Mr. Perry">I mean, and the history of the Venona transcripts and 
recepts show that they infiltrated our Government at the very, 
very highest levels and influence policy in magnificent effect 
in the decades past.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="244" speaker="Mr. Perry">But under--so this is nothing new, but in the current 
context, Madam Secretary, in particular, do we know of--and, 
Secretary, if you know, their incursion into the most recent 
Federal election, the Presidential election, they didn't change 
any of the votes as far as I know, right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="245" speaker="Mr. Perry">We are talking about information gathering and--but I think 
in the greater sense, they are--we are talking about propaganda 
and influence operations as opposed to vote tampering or 
changing. Am I correct in that assessment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="246" speaker="Mr. Perry">    Under Secretary Krebs. So from the extent of our 
understanding in 2016--rather, the extent of their access was 
to voter registration database that was not a vote count, it 
was well kind-of left of voting day. So they were able to get 
into a State voter registration database and exfiltrate some 
data.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="247" speaker="Mr. Perry">Their interest in looking at the voter database
so to speak was to then provide propaganda or information to 
key voters or to target----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="248" speaker="Mr. Perry">Under Secretary Krebs. I am not actually sure that is--that 
that was their intent. In fact, I think to a certain extent, 
they didn't know necessarily what they were looking at. They 
were in a certain--to a certain--perhaps mucking around in a 
system, trying to figure out where they had landed and where 
they were.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="249" speaker="Mr. Perry">    And understand frankly how the systems worked and how they 
interoperated. But to be clear, we did not see them having 
access to any machines, equipment, or whatever that was 
involved in voter--vote tallying.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="250" speaker="Mr. Perry">It is because of the lack of network access and
decentralization of the voting system among States that even if 
they would have wanted to, they figured out where they were and 
they wanted to influence I would have been very, very 
difficult.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="251" speaker="Mr. Perry">That is my understanding, but I want to clarify that, or 
have you----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="252" speaker="Mr. Perry">Under Secretary Krebs. That is certainly a contributing 
factor, yes sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="253" speaker="Mr. Perry">Secretary Perry. OK, and so at this point other than access 
to voter registration, we don't know what their intent was and 
they don't at this point admit that they were ever even 
involved right? They still don't admit that they were ever 
involved but we are fairly confident that they were. Is that 
correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="254" speaker="Mr. Perry">    Under Secretary Krebs. The intelligence community 
assessment from 2017 was pretty clear that they did intend to 
interfere, yes sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="255" speaker="Mr. Perry">But we don't know in what way they----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="256" speaker="Mr. Perry">    Under Secretary Krebs. In what way, I would have to go back 
and do a dig back into the ICA, but----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="257" speaker="Mr. Perry">OK. I think that is important to know to inform
us of future elections. I don't suspect since they deny 
currently that they were even involved, that they will ever 
admit that they are probably going to try to stay involved and 
continue to be involved as they have since for the last 100 
years essentially. Right? They are probably going to--so it 
would be important to know I would think to get an assessment 
of what they were seeking to do if they did in fact get in. We 
should know that so we could safeguard in the future.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="258" speaker="Mr. Perry">But let us go to the Countering Foreign Influence Task 
Force that you talked about regarding propaganda and 
disinformation. We have got an election coming up in about 4 
months. Will that organization be prepared at that time to 
inform, by whatever method it decides and determines is 
appropriate, the American public of things like Russia today or 
ads on social media, etcetera to influence, via propaganda, the 
American electorate? Will that task force be prepared at that 
time to be engaged?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="259" speaker="Mr. Perry">    Under Secretary Krebs. Some of my task force I wouldn't 
think of it as an incident response capability, I think of it 
more as an analytical cell. See what the activities they do 
over time, what their tactics, techniques, and procedures are 
and build up a body of knowledge to then share generally 
speaking. Here are the sorts of things they do. These are the 
sorts of things that the American public should be on the 
lookout for. Other agencies have the more tactical response of 
we are seeing, for instance, the Internet Research Agency 
perhaps do activity X, Y, or Z, that is where the FBI becomes 
involved; that is where other agencies become involved, it is 
more tactical----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="260" speaker="Mr. Perry">OK so I think I have a clear understanding of
that but what I am missing and I think some other Members might 
be missing is once we have that information, once we have that 
track record, then what? Who is going to inform the American 
people of this advertisement is specifically coming from a 
propaganda source whether it is Russia or some other hostile 
Nation or adversarial Nation and to be suspicious of it. Whose 
job in the American--in the Federal Government or State and 
local governments is it to do that informing of the citizenry?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="261" speaker="Mr. Perry">    Under Secretary Krebs. So this is in part a Government and 
industry collaboration. So where we have social media companies 
working with Government we will be able to identify that 
information whether to flag it or take it down similar to 
terrorists use the internet where they remove content, disable 
accounts, that sort of activity can happen on the private-
sector side and on the industry side.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="262" speaker="Mr. Perry">So it is planned solely on the private sector?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="263" speaker="Mr. Perry">    Under Secretary Krebs. No sir, it is--this is truly a 
partnership. This is going to be the Government will be taking 
certain actions then the private sector will be taking certain 
actions. I think if you look at what Twitter has done over the 
last week or so or last month, couple months, where they have 
disabled 70 million accounts by press reports at least. I think 
that is the sort of activity you will see happening going 
forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Perry</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="264" speaker="Mr. Perry"> OK, thanks Mr. Chairman I yield.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="265" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentleman yields. The gentlelady from
Florida, Mrs. Demings is recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="266" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Mrs. Demings. Thank you so much Mr. Chairman and thank you 
to both of you for being here with us today. Congratulations, 
Mr. Under Secretary, and thank you so much for the work that 
you are doing in Rhode Island as well.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="267" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Let me just say I--we have heard a lot about what happened 
in 2016 with our election and I grew up in Florida and Florida 
is the State that kind of keeps everyone up all night, 
especially on general election night. I just, I think everybody 
here understands the importance of protecting our systems but 
let me just say this. I grew up in Florida. I represent a 
district in Florida.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="268" speaker="Chairman McCaul">When I think about my parents, my mother was a maid and my 
father was a janitor, but I cannot remember a time they did not 
exercise their right to vote and I think they were so dedicated 
because they understood that regardless of the color of their 
skin or where they lived or how much money they did not have in 
the bank that their vote mattered, it counted and it counted as 
much as any billionaire or millionaire in this country. So why 
wouldn't we especially, as one of the most powerful bodies in 
the world, in Congress want to protect this basic right for 
every American?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="269" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So I do thank you for the work that you are doing to 
further that goal. Under Secretary, I was a little bit 
surprised as we look at I think the viciousness and consistency 
of Russia and other foreign powers that want to attack our 
system, that more States had not taken advantage of the full 
array of resources that DHS offers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="270" speaker="Chairman McCaul">I know that--I believe you said 17 have participated in the 
risk vulnerability assessments. When we think about--a No. 1, I 
would like to know, what you think you could do to encourage 
more States to participate, even though it is that they have 
the option the ability to opt in or not and also for State like 
Florida, if they did today call and say they want the 
vulnerability risk assessment done, how soon could you get that 
done?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="271" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. So to your first question, what can 
we do more of? We need to continue steady-state engagement 
working through a number of different venues like the National 
Association of Secretaries of State has been a huge partner 
amplifying our message. But it is also important to understand 
that that the DHS service of the risk and vulnerability 
assessment is just one of several options that States have 
available.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="272" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We have approached some States. They have said thank you 
for the offer but we have a private-sector solution that does 
exactly that, that is already on contract, so I don't ever 
frankly anticipate getting all 50 States in the risk and 
vulnerability assessment process. I suspect we maybe get the 25 
maybe 30 that is kind-of a stretch. It is, for us, again, it is 
reaching out, continuing the engagement, continuing the 
education and really frankly more than anything, it is building 
a relationship and building and establishing trust.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="273" speaker="Chairman McCaul">We are still getting, you know, I think for the most part 
we have gotten over kind-of the trust hump that we--the 
challenge that we had last year, I think we are getting there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="274" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So in terms of Florida, or frankly any State that was to 
ask for a risk and vulnerability assessment, we have been very 
clear in how we have communicated to our State partners that as 
soon as you are ready to do a risk and vulnerability 
assessment, we will be there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="275" speaker="Chairman McCaul">There were discussions last time, I think I testified about 
a 9-month backlog. There's no 9-month backlog, it is when the 
State is available to do it and it is not just show up tomorrow 
and we will do a vulnerability assessment. There is a little 
bit of preparation that has to happen. I am sure Secretary 
Gorbea can share her experience, but there is preparation that 
has to happen before we can go in there and do our penetration 
testing. There are legal agreements that have to be signed. 
There's scoping of the networks that we have to do. So there 
are a number of preparatory measures that do lead to some time 
buffer before we can actually get in there.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="276" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    Mrs. Demings. Thank you. Secretary Gorbea.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="277" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">No, I have to say, you know, on the ground, we
have found DHS to be actually very responsive. In fact, one of 
the first things that they--we were probably one of the first 
to sign up for the--under the critical infrastructure set-up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="278" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">Then, the next thing I remember, we had, you know, three 
people showed up in my office and the regional director, a 
program person, a security person all introduced themselves, in 
person. Which I have to say is, probably, on the first times I 
have seen anybody from the Federal Government, you know, sort-
of, show up in my office and introduced themselves to my staff.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="279" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">So, that created a bond in terms of a trust factor because 
I know who I am dealing with and that started our process going 
and we did do the risk and vulnerability assessment. What I 
think, then, what was interesting is to see the disconnect, 
sort-of, in a broader basis as information at the very, sort-
of, in the Classified and intelligence level, sort-of, started 
to happen.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="280" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">There were some misfires in terms of, you know, they would 
contact the locality, but not the chief State election 
official. If you are a chief State election official and you 
are also an elected, you want to know what is going on in your 
State, of course. That was, I think, really just this is all 
new territory for all of us.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="281" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">We are learning cyber stuff, they are learning election 
stuff and I think one of the really big questions, as this 
evolves, is that balance between, you know, the security world 
deals with securing everything down. They don't want to tell, 
you know, they want to tell as few people as possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="282" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">We deal in the world of open government and transparency. 
We need to be transparent. Going back to the point that was 
made earlier, people can--need to be able to trust their 
elections and so they do that because we are open and 
transparent in the way we do things.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="283" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">That is, I think, at the intersection of where the 
challenge is. How do we secure the elections while not losing 
the democracy and the secrecy of it all? Because I can't tell 
you what is happening, but just trust me. Well, no, that is not 
going to work in the elections frame.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="284" speaker="Ms. Gorbea">    Mrs. Demings. Thank you, so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="285" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> The gentlelady yields. The gentlelady from
Arizona, Ms. McSally, is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="286" speaker="Ms. McSally">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for your
testimony today. Look, we know bad actors like Russia have been 
trying to undermine our way of life, our representative 
government. Since the days that I was at the Air Force Academy 
in the mid-1980's, we have been studying their tactics and they 
evolve over time, but it is still the same intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="287" speaker="Ms. McSally">I really appreciate the discussion today. I think it is 
really important. I want to talk about the cybersecurity side 
of this, not the misinformation side and one of those States 
that was hacked was Arizona, I represent southern Arizona. We 
have had a Classified briefing on this, but as you talked 
about, you want to be in the unclassified realm as much as 
possible.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="288" speaker="Ms. McSally">There are all sorts of media reports out there, but what 
can you talk about, Under Secretary Krebs, in this open forum, 
about what happened in Arizona? I know you weren't there, but 
what your organization knows about what happened in Arizona, 
when, how it was detected, who was informed, what was learned 
from it and, you know, the lessons learned going forward? I 
just think it--there is a lot of confusion in the media and it 
will be helpful to clear that up.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="289" speaker="Ms. McSally">Under Secretary Krebs. So, thank you for the question and I 
will go ahead and offer off at the beginning that we come in 
and provide a bit more of a detailed conversation for you. In 
fact, for Arizona, it is one of the more challenging situations 
because it wasn't, necessarily, related directly to Russian 
activity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="290" speaker="Ms. McSally">There--secretaries of state, election officials, by their 
very nature are natural risk managers. They deal with 
hurricanes, power outages, civil unrest, and criminals that 
want to get access to personally identifiable information that 
may reside within voter registration databases. So, every 
attack, particularly those that we--or incident that we have 
seen over the last couple of months, even, it is not always 
Russia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="291" speaker="Ms. McSally">    That is one of the unfortunate aspects of the climate, 
right now, is that every time you see some sort of disruption, 
whether it is intentional, malicious, accidental, everyone is 
jumping to the conclusion of it is Russia. There are things 
that happen on a daily basis in elections that just happen, so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="292" speaker="Ms. McSally">So, in Arizona can--can you just be clearer? I
mean, and by the way, and Russia, criminal elements are often 
acting on behalf of the States.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="293" speaker="Ms. McSally">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes ma'am.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="294" speaker="Ms. McSally">So, let's not be fooled----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="295" speaker="Ms. McSally">    Under Secretary Krebs. But we do have criminals here in the 
United States as well. So, at this point, given the kind of 
confidential nature of some of these conversations, I can't get 
too much into the Arizona piece. But again, I would like to 
follow up with your office on that and see----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="296" speaker="Ms. McSally">Yes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="297" speaker="Ms. McSally">    Secretary Krebs [continuing]. And provide you a little bit 
more information.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="298" speaker="Ms. McSally">I would like to let, again, the key of
openness and transparency, so people understand. It can help 
build their faith in the system that nothing was manipulated, 
but what has been learned from it and what are we doing going 
forward?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="299" speaker="Ms. McSally">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="300" speaker="Ms. McSally">Again, we understand that in all the hacks
that did happen, nothing was manipulated. But it doesn't mean 
it couldn't have been manipulated. Just because it hasn't 
happened, yet, in 2018 doesn't mean it can't happen between now 
and Election Day. If they choose to, right? Threat equals 
capability plus intent.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="301" speaker="Ms. McSally">Even though someone can cast a provisional ballot if a zip 
code was turned around and jumbled up or their street address, 
if we don't know that that happened then the provisional ballot 
will be thrown out. Or if their voter file was deleted, they 
will cast a provisional ballot, it will be compared, and they 
say it is not a voter and it will be thrown out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="302" speaker="Ms. McSally">So, just the, you know, I have a concern about the 
detection and the swift capability, moving forward, for this 
election and beyond because on Election Day, if the lines are 
getting longer and people are hearing something's not right. 
That, in and of itself, meets the intent of the enemy, right? 
That they are sowing confusion and discord, so can you just 
talk little bit about that? Because, again, just because they 
haven't done it yet doesn't mean they can't do it tomorrow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="303" speaker="Ms. McSally">Under Secretary Krebs. That is 100 percent right. That is 
why we are not, necessarily, looking back at specifics. We are 
looking back at the specifics of 2016, but given our broader 
understanding of the I.T. environments that support elections, 
we are looking at, more broadly, where the vulnerabilities are, 
just in the system in general and what are the things we can do 
to address those vulnerabilities, broadly?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="304" speaker="Ms. McSally">    It is not just Arizona. It is obviously all 50 States. So, 
the thing that I reiterate is we are seeing, as I have traveled 
across the country through primary season, I am continually 
impressed by the level of seriousness that secretaries of state 
and State election directors are paying to this issue. They 
want more information. They want more threat information. They 
want more information about how they can understand and manage 
their risk.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="305" speaker="Ms. McSally">Great, thanks. Look, we manage all those at
the county level. We do have our secretary of state role as 
well. We are from Arizona. We are, generally, skeptical of the 
Federal Government being involved in anything.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="306" speaker="Ms. McSally">We are, you know, we are very independent-minded. So, is--
how is your relationship, you know, with the State there and--
and the understanding of the role that you have while still 
allowing this to be localized and distributed which is where is 
belongs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="307" speaker="Ms. McSally">    Under Secretary Krebs. So, we do have a relationship with 
Arizona. We are engaging on a regular basis, I think, as I 
mentioned they are a member of the Election Infrastructure 
ISAC. Every State is different. Every architect of a system is 
different. The threat model is going to be different. Arizona 
is different than Rhode Island, so.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="308" speaker="Ms. McSally">I look forward to following up with you. My
time is----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="309" speaker="Ms. McSally">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. McSally</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="310" speaker="Ms. McSally"> Expired, but, specifically, thanks a lot,
appreciate it. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="311" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentlelady yields the gentlelady from
New York, Miss Rice, is recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="312" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Krebs, last week 
the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan report 
that concurred with the intelligence community's January 2017 
assessment that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 
election to support the Trump campaign. Do you agree with the 
Senate Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community's 
assessment?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="313" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="314" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Miss Rice. Have you shared your opinion with the President?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="315" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. I have not had the opportunity to 
meet with the President, directly, about this issue. I have 
been in briefings with the President on this issue, but I have 
not directly engaged him on--on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="316" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    Miss Rice. Do you think that this is an important enough 
issue to engage him on this issue? Since he has repeatedly 
refused to accept the conclusion of his own intelligence 
community?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kreb</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="317" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Ma'am, residing within a technical agency where I
do at the under secretary level, I am not often afforded the 
opportunity to meet with the President. I don't say this 
jokingly, it is that I, you know, engage on a daily basis 
with----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="318" speaker="Mr. Kreb">    Miss Rice. Have you spoken to the Secretary and suggested 
to her that she speak directly to the President----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Kreb</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="319" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Yes, ma'am. We--I meet with the Secretary
regularly on this issue, and she has directly briefed the 
President on this issue.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="320" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. The Justice Department and Special Counsel 
Robert Mueller charged 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian 
companies in February with various crimes related to 
interfering in the 2016 election, including stealing the 
identities of American citizens. Do you believe that Special 
Council Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="321" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. Ma'am, can you repeat the question? I am 
trying to understand.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="322" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. Yes, I will. The Justice Department and Special 
Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russian nationals and 3 
Russian companies in February with various crimes related to 
interfering in the 2016 election, which is what we have been 
talking about here, including stealing the identities of 
American citizens.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="323" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Do you believe that Special Counsel Mueller's investigation 
is a witch hunt? Yes or no.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="324" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. I certainly don't think that charging the 
Internet Research Agency and those that supported interfering 
with the election a witch hunt, no, ma'am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="325" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. So that is a no, you do not believe it is a 
witch hunt.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="326" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. The 13 indictments you just indicated, I do 
not believe that those are witch hunts. I think those are 
legitimate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="327" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. Mueller's investigation into at least that 
portion of it, you are saying is----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="328" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am. I am not aware of the rest of 
the investigation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="329" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. Do you think the overall investigation is a 
witch hunt?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="330" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. Ma'am, I am not aware of the scope and 
extent of the investigation again, I engage every day with 
State and local election officials on securing their systems, 
I--you know, I read what I can in the paper, I am not privy to 
Special Council Mueller's investigation and the scope of it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="331" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. Well, in your position, you should know than 
more than you are at least attributing yourself knowledge of. 
Will President Trump be discussing Russian interference in the 
2016 election in his meeting with President Vladimir Putin next 
week?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="332" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. Based on the press reports that I have 
seen, yes, ma'am, that is part of the agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="333" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. Well I would assume that before that meeting, 
the President is going to sit down with his top people, one of 
whom is your boss, Secretary Nielsen. Will you recommend to 
Secretary Nielsen since you don't get direct face time I guess 
to talk to the President, will you be recommending to her that 
she recommend to the President that he discussed Russian 
interference in U.S. elections with President Putin?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="334" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. Again, based on press reports, that will be 
part of the conversation. Of course I would suggest if I had 
that conversation with the Secretary----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="335" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. Do you think you should have that conversation 
with her?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="336" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. Again, I speak to the Secretary about this 
matter on almost a daily basis and we have encouraged it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="337" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. Have you specifically about this issue that I am 
asking you about, whether she is going to recommend as one of 
his advisors that he should bring this up in a serious manner 
with President Putin?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="338" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. I would recommend that, yes, ma'am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="339" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Miss Rice. OK, so just a clarification, why DHS countering 
foreign influence task force, how it is different from the FBI 
foreign influence task force, we can debate that all day long.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="340" speaker="Mr. Kreb">But why is there not just one comprehensive task force on 
this critical issue?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="341" speaker="Mr. Kreb">Secretary Kreb. So I think the challenge here is that from 
a information operations perspective of what Russia has 
launched over the last couple years, the Government is not 
necessarily directly organized from a--there's no single set of 
jurisdictions, frankly; these issues like the FBI's law 
enforcement authorities, my authorities to meet with private-
sector companies and build awareness and resilience within the 
system.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="342" speaker="Mr. Kreb">We are working toward something like you are suggesting, 
whether it is a single task force, but we do coordinate on a 
regular basis. I meet at the under secretary level on an almost 
weekly basis with my counterparts and a number of different 
agencies, there are meetings in the National Security Council, 
and there's staff technical level meetings between DHS, the 
FBI, the Global Engagement Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="343" speaker="Mr. Kreb">    Miss Rice. Thank you, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="344" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> Gentlelady yields, the--let us see,
gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Bacon.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bacon</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="345" speaker="Mr. Bacon">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you both
for being here today. I just want to ask Under Secretary Krebs 
a--question for clarity. I think you have been touching on it a 
little bit, I just want to make sure we have it right.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="346" speaker="Mr. Bacon">Is there anything else you need from Congress, whether it 
is resources, the--you know, a budget, the appropriations and 
so forth, is there anything else you need from us to safeguard 
our elections systems from hacking or manipulation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="347" speaker="Mr. Bacon">Under Secretary Krebs. So I think from a--thank you for the 
question. I think from a pure authorities perspective, I think 
we have everything we need to support State and local 
governments in their election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="348" speaker="Mr. Bacon">I think with more, from a resourcing perspective, I could 
always do more. But we are learning from our past engagements, 
whether it is risk and vulnerability assessments or some of the 
other capabilities that we are providing.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="349" speaker="Mr. Bacon">The $26.2 million we were providing in the omnibus--the 
fiscal year 2018 omnibus, certainly helped increase our 
bandwidth, not just for election systems, but also in those 
other infrastructure sectors that Congressman Langevin 
mentioned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="350" speaker="Mr. Bacon">So we are always looking at how to be more efficient in the 
things we do and make sure that we are operating off of 
requirements. The last thing I would add on that front is given 
the nature of a public-private partnership, everything has to 
be based on the demand signal as we are calling it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="351" speaker="Mr. Bacon">    The relationship, frankly, between State officials has only 
really been at what I would say a healthy level for not even a 
year now, maybe about a year now. It is still--we are still 
defining what the requirement sets are, and that is going to be 
something over the next 6 months, particularly in kind-of the 
hot wash after 2018, we will get back to--we will pause, 
reflect, do a hot wash, figure out where we need to go going 
forward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bacon</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="352" speaker="Mr. Bacon">One of the problems we hear is that our State
and local officials don't have the right clearances to work 
with some of these things. Are we getting that problem solved? 
Are we making progress?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="353" speaker="Mr. Bacon">Under Secretary Krebs. We are, we have taken a pretty hard 
look at the clearance process. I think at this point we have 
got about 37 States that have a senior election official with a 
clearance, 9 more are in the processing, a handful have 
declined for whatever reason, and they may have other officials 
in the State that have access to the information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="354" speaker="Mr. Bacon">Others are still in the decision-making process. Very--it 
is a limited number. But I will also kind-of pull back on the 
clearance piece a little bit. As I mentioned earlier, we are 
doing everything possible we can to take things or to operate 
in the unclassified space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="355" speaker="Mr. Bacon">    I would also suggest that the Classified information piece 
and the clearance issue is not necessarily the driving factor 
for our engagements. In a year-and-a-half ago or in 2016, 
having never met Secretary Gorbea, if I would called her up and 
said you need to take care of this system right now, she would 
have said I don't know who you are, I am not going to do that. 
I have no reason to trust you. Now, if I called her up and said 
hey, look, we are seeing something, you need to take care of 
this problem, based on the trust and the relationship we have 
developed, even without a clearance I have fairly good 
confidence that Secretary Gorbea would at least give me a flier 
and then we would follow up afterwards.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bacon</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="356" speaker="Mr. Bacon">One last question here, we are seeing more and
more attacks from Russia against Ukraine's critical 
infrastructure, and it seems to me they are using it as a test 
to practice their techniques and capabilities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="357" speaker="Mr. Bacon">First of all would you agree with that and second, what are 
we learning from watching what Russia is doing with Ukraine? 
Because clearly those same capabilities they are using--they 
are studying us to the same if they need to.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="358" speaker="Mr. Bacon">Under Secretary Krebs. I think that is a fair assessment 
that Ukraine is perhaps a pilot or a test bed. In terms of what 
we are learning, they are getting better. You know each 
subsequent incident shows that increased level of capability. 
So what we are doing is sitting back and looking at, OK, what 
is the capability that they have demonstrated and what are the 
corresponding vulnerabilities or exposure or risk level here in 
the United States and then how do we work with our critical 
infrastructure community to help them understand that risk and 
do the things they need to do and how can we help them 
understand that risk and do the things they need to do and how 
can we help them do that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="359" speaker="Mr. Bacon">One of the things that I think I--we need to move beyond 
information sharing. Information sharing is the foundation of 
how you manage risk. We need to do and continue move into is a 
risk management integration space. This is the importance of 
avoiding the silos because increasingly these systems, whether 
it is industrial control systems, or just general I.T. systems, 
are almost agnostic to sectors, or at least they cut across 
several sectors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="360" speaker="Mr. Bacon">    So we need to be working cross-sector government industry 
together to do integrated risk assessments, integrated 
strategic planning, and integrated risk mitigation strategy. So 
there is a lot more ahead of us and this is one things were 
really focusing on right now at NPPD.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Bacon</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="361" speaker="Mr. Bacon"> Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="362" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> The gentleman yields back. The gentleman
from California, Mr. Correa, is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="363" speaker="Mr. Correa">Thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all Honorable
Krebs, Honorable Gorbea, I want to thank you for being here 
today and I also want to thank you for the good job you are 
doing. I know sometimes it goes unappreciated, but we are 
relying on you, OK?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="364" speaker="Mr. Correa">I wanted to follow up, on it on this committee we talk 
about best practices when it comes to cybersecurity, financial 
institutions, I would presume that right now cross the 50 
States, we have some kind of semblance of coordination were 
those best practices are being applied at every one of those 50 
States when it comes to the elections?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="365" speaker="Mr. Correa">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes sir through the Election 
Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center. 
Basically, to kind-of unpack what that means is it is a group 
of all 50 States including other election officials that are 
connected in a manner that if one has a best practice or an 
observation they want to share then all 50 are all----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="366" speaker="Mr. Correa">What about in a situation where we have had
recently that you have a cyber attack on financial institutions 
within nano seconds everybody is on top of it so that people 
figure out that there's actually an attack going on and people 
can respond to it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="367" speaker="Mr. Correa">    Under Secretary Krebs. Let me actually give you a practical 
example from the election community.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="368" speaker="Mr. Correa">Yes, sir.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="369" speaker="Mr. Correa">    Under Secretary Krebs. A few months ago, there was a 
phishing attack not necessarily attributed to a nation-state, 
but a phishing attack on the State election system. What 
happened is that State detected the phishing attack, worked 
with DHS, and then we were able to share indicators across the 
EI-ISAC. Now, did this happen in a matter of seconds or even 
minutes, no. But what we gain through this approach of 
community or collective defense is broader community----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="370" speaker="Mr. Correa">Will you be able to get to get there
eventually? I know there are a lot of issues, costs, software, 
hardware, will you be able to get to that level when you have 
an attack you are able to respond almost immediately?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="371" speaker="Mr. Correa">    Under Secretary Krebs. I think ultimately that is our 
aspiration of course.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="372" speaker="Mr. Correa">I ask that question following up Ms. McSally's
point which is trust. I am from the State of California. We are 
like Arizona, we mistrust the Federal Government, but we try to 
work with the Federal Government. Yet, really in these 
elections, the issue is trust. If you wake up Wednesday morning 
and somebody fried your software system and there are questions 
of the validity of those election results, we are going to have 
major challenges to our democracy in this country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="373" speaker="Mr. Correa">    You know I am trying to--in my mind trying to figure out 
what can we do to help you to make sure that that is not a 
reality one of these Wednesday mornings?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="374" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> Sir if I may----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="375" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="376" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> From the State level, so I think it is this
risk mitigation right. We can't just rely on we are going to 
put a wall around our systems and that is to protect us from 
everything.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="377" speaker="Mr. Correa"> That comes back to the issue of ultimately you
come back to paper ballots as being----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="378" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> Paper ballots are absolutely critical in my
opinion. People ask me all the time, do you think on-line 
voting should happen? I am like no not really because I for 
one, even though despite----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="379" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Most of the folks I know that show up to
California to vote actually vote electronically.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="380" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> So I know that California is a very large State
with many different systems----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="381" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Yes, yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="382" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> I know that Secretary Padilla has been doing a
fantastic job.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="383" speaker="Mr. Correa"> I will let him know you said that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="384" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> But going back to--we talked about provisional
ballots for example, right. So say something happens and you 
show up and your name is not on the voter registry, that is as 
important in my mind to look at what is our provisional 
balloting system as it is what the machines are, because the 
machines are, in a sense, easy. You can come in, you can buy 
them, you put them, you install them, but then what if they 
don't work? What if somebody sabotages them? What is that next 
step? We have very different provisional ballot systems in this 
country. In Rhode Island that is a very simple process----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="385" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Do you think that is a formula for major chaos
one of these Wednesday mornings that everybody has their own 
different way of doing it? This is State of Florida, hanging 
chads all over again.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="386" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> I think it is worth examining it. I understand
that given--that while----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="387" speaker="Mr. Correa">I only have 40 seconds left. I just want to be
quick here but I would like to talk to you a little bit more on 
this. I used to chair elections when I was in the State senate 
in California so we dealt with these issues a little bit. Not 
to the extent we are dealing with them now but my final 
question and this is one for you maybe to answer or not to 
answer for us here. At what point does a foreign nation's 
interference in our electoral system constitute a declaration 
of war in our country?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="388" speaker="Mr. Correa">    Under Secretary Krebs. I think that is the right policy 
question we need to have right now. I don't have an answer for 
you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="389" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> I agree. I think that is one of the critical
questions we need to ask.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Correa</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="390" speaker="Mr. Correa"> Thank you very much. Mr. Chair, I yield.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="391" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentleman yields, and I appreciate
that question. We have been trying to define that for quite 
some time. Was it an act of cyber warfare? I appreciate you 
raising that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="392" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    The gentleman from New York, Mr. Donovan.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Donovan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="393" speaker="Mr. Donovan"> I am your last questioner.

    <paragraph paraId="394" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> At least on this side.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Donovan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="395" speaker="Mr. Donovan">Yes. The title of the hearing was ``DHS's
Progress in Securing Election Systems and Other Critical 
Infrastructure.'' I would just like to ask about the other 
critical infrastructure for a moment, since you are both here. 
Secretary Gorbea, you said before in your opening statement 
about balancing our needs for secrecy with our need for 
transparency, a very difficult thing to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="396" speaker="Mr. Donovan">Mr. Krebs, during, you know some of the other attacks that 
we have seen on our health care systems, our dams, our oil and 
natural gas systems, the cyber attacks on our energy 
industries, how do we balance that need for secrecy and 
transparency and how do we as a Government share 
vulnerabilities with private industry? We all have this same 
common goal here is to protect our energy system, our 
electrical grids.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="397" speaker="Mr. Donovan">But then, again, there is a difficulty, I suspect, with 
industry, particularly those who have competitors, of revealing 
that they are vulnerable. They don't want to lose the 
confidence of their clients or their users.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="398" speaker="Mr. Donovan">So how do we balance that stuff? I know it is not an easy 
question and there's not an easy answer for that, but since I 
am the last one on this side of the aisle, I will throw you a 
hardball.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="399" speaker="Mr. Donovan">    Under Secretary Krebs. That is a----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Donovan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="400" speaker="Mr. Donovan">Thanks.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="401" speaker="Mr. Donovan">[Laughter.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="402" speaker="Mr. Donovan">Under Secretary Krebs. That is a great question. The way I 
kind-of break this up, right now, at least, is to look at 
opportunistic attacks and then more strategic adversary 
attacks. So when you think about what happened last summer or 
last fall with WannaCry, the United States was generally not 
terribly affected, unlike some of our European counterparts, 
and look at what happened in Russia and elsewhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="403" speaker="Mr. Donovan">The reason for that was, in part, because we did a fairly 
good job, I think, in a Government-industry partnership, of 
sharing information, indicators, working with the security 
research community to see what they saw. Then there were some 
security researchers that took certain activities to help out. 
But it started before WannaCry even launched, in that we had 
raised the level of awareness, we would worked with, whether it 
was the Government doing it, or just in general, the level of 
awareness, people had done the right cyber hygiene basics to 
protect their systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="404" speaker="Mr. Donovan">They had patched their operating systems, they had patched 
their software, so that the majority of the vulnerabilities had 
been closed down. So from an opportunistic perspective, I think 
we are--we are certainly making progress; we are improving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="405" speaker="Mr. Donovan">Now, this is always a question of resourcing; I have said 
that before today. When we think about the recent rash of 
ransomware attacks, those are similarly opportunistic attacks--
Colorado, Atlanta, Baltimore, Mecklenburg County, Charlotte--
those were all attacks that had been, you know, they were 
scanned, their systems were scanned, they found 
vulnerabilities, they went in, locked them up and said, ``I 
want $50,000.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="406" speaker="Mr. Donovan">That is an example of not necessarily doing the basics. So 
we are really stressing to prevent opportunistic attacks, which 
is, generally speaking, about 85 percent of, these are, you 
know, soft numbers, not empirically based but good enough to go 
by for the purposes of this discussion of, you do the basics 
right, and you can drive most of the bad actors out of the 
space, the general hackers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="407" speaker="Mr. Donovan">Now, from a strategic perspective, we do know, as I talked 
with Congressman Bacon earlier, we do know that the adversary's 
getting better, particularly in our hard infrastructure space. 
We saw them last summer, we released a report earlier this 
year, along with the FBI, on Russian activity in 
infrastructure. We saw them in energy, critical manufacturing, 
transportation, aviation.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="408" speaker="Mr. Donovan">We are currently seeing them, presently, in the information 
technology side, the I.T. side. Now, the problem is, once they 
get more comfortable operating in the operational technology 
side. So that is where we are focusing right now.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="409" speaker="Mr. Donovan">I mentioned earlier, we talked about siloing, we talked 
about this shift from information sharing to risk management. 
That is where we are driving a great deal of our effort right 
now. It is taking a piece of threat intelligence, like, I know 
the amount of intelligence I see on a daily basis, it is 
overwhelming, but what--I need to do a better job of working 
with industry and saying, this piece of intelligence, so what? 
What does it mean? What does it mean to that system, this 
system, to the Nation, to a region?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="410" speaker="Mr. Donovan">    Figuring that piece out and then asking the question, what 
are we going to do about it? That is principally where we are 
focused, and we are kicking off a new initiative within NPPD, 
the National Risk Management Initiative, that is really going 
to focus in on moving beyond intelligence and into risk 
management. Of understanding what the problem is, how to 
address it and doing it in a cross-sector Government-industry 
partnership manner. I think that is where we are going to make 
the most significant gain.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Donovan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="411" speaker="Mr. Donovan">You are right. I thank you both for your
service.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="412" speaker="Mr. Donovan">    I yield, Mr. Chairman.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="413" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentleman yields.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="414" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    The gentlelady from California, Ms. Barragan, is 
recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="415" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you both
for being here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="416" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Secretary Krebs, I wanted to ask, last month, I believe, 
the Senate Intelligence Committee had put out a report called, 
``Russia Targeting of Election Infrastructure During the 2016 
Election.'' I assume you have seen that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="417" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="418" speaker="Ms. Barragan">In that report, there was a paragraph, a
sentence that said, ``although the DHS provided warning to I.T. 
staff in the fall of 2016, notifications to State election 
officials were delayed by nearly a year.'' That is pretty 
startling to read, and I think I hear from local elected 
officials, that is concerning that the Federal Government knew 
of something yet they didn't get notice of it. I think I read 
about North Carolina having problems on election day, and them 
having no idea about the possible breaches and concerns that 
were happening. What are you doing to make sure that doesn't 
happen again?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="419" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Under Secretary Krebs. So on the top end, we have 
established a series of information-sharing protocols, working 
with the Government Coordinating Counsel to say, hey, when we 
get something or we see something, these are the five officials 
in each State and the system owner that we would notify.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="420" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Secretary Gorbea mentioned it earlier, you know, a year ago 
or even before that, they were trying to figure out the 
cybersecurity side of it; DHS was trying to figure out the 
election side of it. We are past that, we really committed to 
working together, we have built partnerships, we have 
established trust and we are really getting to that point of 
understanding what they need from us and we are reacting 
accordingly. So I have great confidence that if we did see 
something, that I would know exactly who to go to in each State 
to share that information.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="421" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    We will not be in a position like we were in 2016, when, 
frankly, we were in kind of uncharted territory, for us at the 
time, at least.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="422" speaker="Ms. Barragan">So are you suggesting that the then-under
secretary didn't know who to call at these--in these States, to 
let them know----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="423" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Under Secretary Krebs. There was no election infrastructure 
subsector. So these relationships were not established at the 
time. So my predecessor, who I have spoken with about this, 
they--what they did was follow a traditional incident response 
protocol. They notified the State or the asset owner, which may 
have been a county or may have been a private-sector owner-
operator, and that is the playbook.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="424" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Going through the process now, we understand that this is a 
unique community, this is a unique subsector, and what works in 
other sectors doesn't work here, and we have changed our 
protocols accordingly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="425" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Is DHS in a position to detect if there is
such meddling happening in all of the 50 States? In other 
words, does DHS have any visibility into whether relevant State 
systems are being targeted?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="426" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Under Secretary Krebs. So since, frankly, February of this 
year, we have quadrupled our insight into State activities. We 
have an intrusion detection system that is called Albert, it is 
similar to a system the Federal Government uses, that we have 
deployed out. Now, I mentioned 21 States earlier, in part, 
those 21 States, we saw that activity because of the deployed 
Albert sensors at the time.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="427" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Like I mentioned, we have quadrupled our insights since 
just February of this year. By the mid-terms of--by November of 
this year, we will have almost every State covered down on and 
we have significant coverage across counties in other 
jurisdictions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="428" speaker="Ms. Barragan">OK. My understanding is that there is no
Nationally-mandated security requirements for election 
technology vendors nor are they subject to a consistent set of 
breach notification laws. How would you characterize DHS's 
relationship with election-related vendors?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="429" speaker="Ms. Barragan">Under Secretary Krebs. So, we--there are actually a 
complementary group called the Sector Coordinating Council. So, 
on the Government Coordinating Council you have State and local 
election officials and then on the Sector Coordinating Council 
side, we have vendors will all the major technology providers 
to elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="430" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Frankly, we took up, kind-of, an incremental approach. We 
started building strong relationships with the State partners 
and local partners and we are moving--we have the Sector 
Coordinating Council established and the relationships are 
growing. They are not, frankly, probably where they need to be, 
but they are getting there.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="431" speaker="Ms. Barragan">My last question to you sir, is, we know that
the President doesn't believe in the meddling and you have 
already indicated you believe the intelligence reports. What 
does it do to morale, to the people under you to know that 
their commander, the top guy, doesn't even believe that there 
was any meddling when that is what you guys are doing? Your 
mission is to go out and stop it from happening and preventing, 
you know, them to interfere in our democracy. What does that do 
to the people under you?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="432" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Under Secretary Krebs. I think generally speaking, the 
morale on my team is really high right now. I think the ability 
to work with folks with Secretary Gorbea--the way I see it, a 
high functioning organization.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="433" speaker="Ms. Barragan">So, you don't see an impact at all from the
President's speak about this to your team?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="434" speaker="Ms. Barragan">    Under Secretary Krebs. I am just saying in general, the 
morale of my team is very high.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Barragan</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="435" speaker="Ms. Barragan"> Great, thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="436" speaker="Chairman McCaul"> The gentlelady yields. The gentleman from
Massachusetts, Mr. Keating, is recognized.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="437" speaker="Mr. Keating">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank
you for being here. Just a question since I had a conflicting 
hearing. But what is the attitude--range of attitude among 
local and State officials when you are saying, we are here to 
give you some help? Do some of them say, don't worry I have it 
covered, I am confident our system is fine? Is that something 
you hear?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="438" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Every State is a different 
experience.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="439" speaker="Mr. Keating">No, but have you heard that? That is what I
asked.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="440" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. I have heard some States say, we are 
resourced. I have been told rather that some States have said, 
we have the resources and the capabilities----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="441" speaker="Mr. Keating">Are you just waiting--have you reached out to
all the State and local officials?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="442" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. We have engaged every single State.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="443" speaker="Mr. Keating">OK. So, you have heard back from those
officials or you?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="444" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="445" speaker="Mr. Keating">So, some of them just feel confident, no
problem, got it covered?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="446" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Every State is working with DHS in 
some capacity.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="447" speaker="Mr. Keating">Well, I know that. I just asked what your
experience was. I mean, it is not a tough question. It is 
just--are you getting that feedback, don't worry, I am 
confident, I have got it covered, from those officials?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="448" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir. I think some States feel 
that they have--they are adequately resources or adequately 
supported. Others, like insurance policies, and even though 
they may have things covered, they will still take some of 
our----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="449" speaker="Mr. Keating">Do you think that we are going to be attacked
in 4 months by Russia?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="450" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I don't have any information or 
evidence to suggest they are going to attack us, but we don't 
need that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="451" speaker="Mr. Keating">Do you share information with our intelligence
officials, then?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="452" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. They share with me, yes, sir. I am 
not a collector.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="453" speaker="Mr. Keating">They believe we are going to be attacked. So,
you don't believe--opinions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="454" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. I don't think I have seen that 
assessment that they are going to attack our election. That 
the--Secretary Gorbea----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="455" speaker="Mr. Keating">You haven't heard that from our intelligence
officials? U.S. intelligence official, you haven't heard that 
one?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="456" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. I have--you know, maybe I need to go 
back and review, but.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="457" speaker="Mr. Keating">Yes, I think so. I think----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="458" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I think what they have said is 
that----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="459" speaker="Mr. Keating">I think our intelligence officials are saying
they are going to do it again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="460" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. I think that they have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="461" speaker="Mr. Keating">Meaning Russia.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="462" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir. Russia, I think they--
Russia is engaging in information operations whether it is 
focused on elections or not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="463" speaker="Mr. Keating">Well, our intelligence--maybe I am wrong? But
intelligence is saying----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="464" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. No, I am--sir, I am not suggesting.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="465" speaker="Mr. Keating">They are going to do it again. You don't
believe they are going to do it again?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="466" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. I wouldn't put----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="467" speaker="Mr. Keating">You don't agree with our intelligence
officials?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="468" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. I wouldn't put anything past the 
Russians. I am not disagreeing with any intelligence. I am 
just--what I am saying is.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="469" speaker="Mr. Keating">I am just saying, don't you agree with our
intelligence--the people that are saying that?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="470" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes sir, I agree----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="471" speaker="Mr. Keating">Wow. That was----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="472" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. With our intelligence community.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="473" speaker="Mr. Keating">Sorry about that, but. Are we sufficiently
ready for this attack? What kind of guarantee can you give us 
that we are up to the task?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="474" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. I have confidence in the resilience 
of the system. I have, I think, some of the controlling 
measures that we have in place, whether it is provisional 
ballots as we discussed or some of the other compensating 
controls. We think, you know, is it 100 percent----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="475" speaker="Mr. Keating">Can you guarantee?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="476" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Of course not.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="477" speaker="Mr. Keating">No. And it is likely that there could be some
difficulty. It is in the realm of possibility, correct?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="478" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I, you now, I am paid to be 
paranoid. I plan for bad days and that is what we are working 
toward.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="479" speaker="Mr. Keating">Yes. Well, have you reached out, as a rule,
and communicated the fact that it is likely we are going to be 
attacked now that you know that, and will--in fact, will be 
attacked? No. 2, that despite the great efforts of mitigating 
this that can't cover that, have you reached out to all of our 
officials and said, we believe, strongly, you should move to 
paper ballots?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="480" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. It is a baseline recommendation of 
the Department, working with the GCC and others that--yes, 
paper trails, verifiable, auditable paper trails are a best 
practice, period.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="481" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Yes. Secretary Gorbea, what are you--what are
your colleagues, Nation-wide, what are you hearing back? I 
mean, to me this is a strong statement that you come from. 
Despite our efforts, you know, our best efforts to try and 
mitigate this, that there should be paper ballots? That is what 
we should be doing, frankly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="482" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> I wholeheartedly agree and I give a lot of
credit to Congressman Langevin for when he was the Secretary of 
State. He started us on this paper ballot process with optical 
scan readers and when I came into office those--that equipment 
was outdated and we replaced it with similar because there 
should always be something that you can touch and feel that you 
and I can look at and say, this is how the voter wanted to----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="483" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Particularly provisional ballot because if
they do get in the infrastructure and they can manipulate data, 
those provisional ballots are going to be critical.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="484" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> That is right. But that is where looking at the
various systems and rules around provisional ballots are really 
important because in Rhode Island, those provision ballots are 
reviewed by election officials----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="485" speaker="Mr. Keating"> Is our government, the U.S. Government, the
Federal Government, communicated to all election officials 
sufficiently, in your opinion, that there will be an attack 
that their efforts to mitigate it, but no guarantees there that 
they can be successful; you should move to paper ballots. Has 
it been that strong a message or is just the recommendation?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="486" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> I think we are all in this space, very
concerned about making sure that we mitigate the risk. We don't 
need, necessarily, the Federal Government to tell us this 
because we see it everywhere. So, I think all States are taking 
measures.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="487" speaker="Mr. Keating"> How many States are moving to paper ballots?
It is 4 months away.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. Gorbea</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="488" speaker="Ms. Gorbea"> I don't have the answer to that, but the
National Association of Secretaries of State might be able to 
provide that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="489" speaker="Mr. Keating">Do you know, Under Secretary Krebs?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="490" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I know that 5 States, right 
now, are exclusively on non-paper ballot systems. Of those 5, 4 
are in the RFP process. One is, you know, waiting for money, 
frankly.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="491" speaker="Mr. Keating">So, it is pretty prevalent that there is going
to be paper ballots? That is reassuring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="492" speaker="Mr. Keating">    KREBS: It--so, I think on the balance there are paper 
ballots, but there are still systems out there that do not have 
paper ballots.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="493" speaker="Mr. Keating">Percentage-wise, again?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="494" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Off the top of my head, I don't have 
percentages.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="495" speaker="Mr. Keating">I would suggest that is something we should
know. That would be----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="496" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. So, happy to.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="497" speaker="Mr. Keating">That you could do that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="498" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir, happy to circle back 
with--and work with the Election Assistance Commission----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="499" speaker="Mr. Keating">That would be helpful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="500" speaker="Mr. Keating">    Under Secretary Krebs. And the secretaries----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Keating</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="501" speaker="Mr. Keating"> I realize your limitations. I appreciate your
testimony and your good work. As a last comment, dealing with 
the Russians, our intelligence said they are doing it again. We 
have to have deterrents, as well as a rope-a-dope approach, 
where we are just doing our best to mitigate it, and I hope 
that is done. I know it is not in your specific purview. It is 
certainly not yours at the State level, but in the interim, I 
think we should give the strongest message possible for paper 
ballots. That will deter them in the actual infrastructure 
apparatus attempts to get into our system. On a larger scale, I 
believe very strongly that the sanctions and the deterrents 
that we have at the upper levels are critical. So thank you for 
your work. I yield back.

    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="502" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The gentleman yields. The gentlelady from
Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, is recognized.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="503" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me thank the Chairman and Ranking 
Member for holding this hearing, and to the witnesses, let me 
thank you, as well. Committee business in judiciary proceeding 
on issues that dealt with the 2016 election delayed me. But 
this is an important hearing, and I want to follow the line of 
reasoning of my colleague, Mr. Keating, and maybe in a 
different perspective.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="504" speaker="Chairman McCaul">To both of you, let me thank you for the service that you 
give. But I believe that this will be a Federal election in a 
large way. The Congress will be up for reelection, the House in 
totality, the Senate partially. So this is a Federal election, 
and I have the greatest respect for State officers, and they 
are our collaborators. But I would say to the Secretary that it 
is the responsibility of the Federal Government to at least 
provide the structure and the walls of security upon which you 
can work within, or even add to by your own expertise.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="505" speaker="Chairman McCaul">With that in mind, I frankly believe that this Government 
has not been effective in recognizing the larger picture, and 
that is the enormous involvement and invasion that Russia 
perpetrated in 2016, and in elections before that, where we 
probably did not have all of the analysis. I do not believe 
that we are solidly in control, and facing what is a potential 
of invasion, interference, and altering and skewing of the 
election by the Russians, and maybe some others. I don't 
believe, in particular, that the commander-in-chief has been 
particularly effective in acknowledging that invasion in 2016, 
and I would hope in his meeting that I certainly have concern 
with, with Vladimir Putin, that that will be No. 1 in his 
agenda.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="506" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Secretary Krebs, do you know whether the President will be 
discussing election fraud, election challenges, in his meeting 
with the head of Russia?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="507" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am, that is my 
understanding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="508" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Ms. Jackson Lee. Have you given him or the Secretary of 
Homeland Security--I don't know if she is there, but the State 
Department, those are all diplomats. Have you given him a 
matrix, a list of questions or information to the White House 
that he will be well-informed in his questioning?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="509" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. Ma'am, I personally have not, and I 
would need to get back to you on whether the Secretary----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="510" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Ms. Jackson Lee. But you think it would be important that 
those questions be raised?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="511" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. I think that that is a useful 
conversation, yes, ma'am, just a----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="512" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Ms. Jackson Lee. I hope more than useful. Let me----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="513" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Under Secretary Krebs. Stern warning, yes ma'am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="514" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Ms. Jackson Lee. Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 3202, 
the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which passed 
the House earlier this year with the help of this committee and 
the Chairman and Ranking Member. The bill requires the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on the 
policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber 
availability disclosures. The report will include an annex with 
information on instances in which cybersecurity vulnerability, 
disclosure policies, and procedures were used to disclose 
details on identified weaknesses in computing sciences or 
digital services at risk. The report will provide information 
on the degree to which the information provided by DHS was used 
by industry and other stakeholders in a closed setting.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="515" speaker="Chairman McCaul">The reason I worked on this bill before the full House for 
consideration is a problem often referred to as ``zero-day 
events.'' Zero-day event describes the situation that network 
security professionals may find themselves when a previously 
unknown error or flaw in computing code is exploited by cyber 
criminals, or terrorists, or someone who wants to undermine our 
elections. That is the level that I think we may be at, at some 
point in our election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="516" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So, Mr. Secretary, I ask you, do you, in fact, have the 
kind of infrastructure at DHS that can be prepared for 
catastrophic events dealing with the Nation's democracy, these 
elections? DHS employees stand on the front lines of Federal 
Government efforts to defend our Nation's critical 
infrastructure from natural disasters, terrorism, adversarial 
threats, technological risks such as those caused by cyber 
threats.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="517" speaker="Chairman McCaul">    So my concern would be elections that I hope are classified 
as critical infrastructure. Are you confident that you have a 
team that, if the secretary from Rhode Island reaches out, even 
with her good works, to the Federal Government, where are we in 
protecting election, detecting Russian invasion and altering 
our election system?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. Krebs</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="518" speaker="Mr. Krebs">So generally speaking, I think we have a team
that is elastic, in that we can focus on a number of different 
infrastructure sectors, and when an acute need arises, we can 
surge into a specific sector like election infrastructure. So 
if I got that call from Secretary Gorbea, and she needed a fly-
in team of ``X'' number of people, we could deliver that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="519" speaker="Mr. Krebs">With more, though, I can, of course, do more. So we are 
taking a look at what the threat picture looks like, what our 
ability to manage risk across the country is, and the demand 
signal from our stakeholders. All of our engagements are 
voluntary in this space, so I have to have a requirement set. I 
have to have a demand signal. If Secretary Gorbea needs 
something, and if I get 49 other secretaries that say they need 
something, that compounds into a very clear demand----</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="520" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Ms. Jackson Lee. So do we need to write legislation to give 
you requirements of indicia that says, this is when you shoot 
into a State that is impacted by what they think is a cyber 
threat in their elections, and you need to dispatch. Are you 
voluntarily sending staff there? Or do you have legislative 
authority?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="521" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Under Secretary Krebs. I think it is a--I have legislative 
authority to send folks on instant response capabilities. That 
was already been provided.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="522" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Ms. Jackson Lee. And resources? And resources?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="523" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Under Secretary Krebs. So it depends on the level of the 
incident. You know, we don't have 1,000 people sitting on a 
bench waiting for a phone call. We have folks that are 
providing incident response capabilities. They are providing 
hunt capabilities, risk and vulnerability assessments. It is 
based--like I said, elasticity is critical here, because folks 
can do something on Monday, and they do something different on 
Tuesday, and we will deal with surge.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="524" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Ms. Jackson Lee. Well, Mr. Secretary, it was humorous to 
say 1,000 people on the bench. Some of us are very much into 
sports, and we would like to have 1,000 so we could substitute 
out those who are not working. But the point is it may be 
1,000--you know, this is a big Nation, 300 million-plus, and it 
may be 1,000 incidents in the middle of a high-profile 
election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="525" speaker="Mr. Krebs">I consider the Federal elections certainly are the highest 
profile, although State elections, Governors, State legislators 
and others certainly are part of the democratic infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="526" speaker="Mr. Krebs">What I am saying is, with all seriousness, that I believe 
that you should be prepared in this infrastructure scheme, and 
there are many others. I could be talking about the electric 
grid and others. I don't have the time to do so. But I want to 
focus, because I don't believe that the administration--and you 
are in there as part of it. I am not saying your direct 
office--has given this the attention and the sensitivity and 
seriousness that I, frankly, believe puts you in the seat, 
along with the Secretary of Homeland Security to get those 
1,000 people on the bench, and if they are needed from sea to 
signing she--signing she--sea, that we are able to protect the 
election of the voters of the American people. That is what I 
am trying to hear from you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="527" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am, I understand your concern.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="528" speaker="Mr. Krebs">I will tell you this much, and hopefully the experience is 
validated by Secretary Gorbea, but I spend 40 to 50 percent of 
my time right now, almost exclusively on elections. There is no 
way I could take this any more seriously than I do and my team 
sees that. We have capabilities across this organization that 
are able to surge in to this space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="529" speaker="Mr. Krebs">So when we think about mid-terms, when we think about 
November--there are protective security advisors distributed 
across this country, 130 or 140 of them. I have got 
cybersecurity advisors distributed across this country, on any 
given day they are working across the 16 sectors. In November 
they will be focused on election infrastructure; that is just 
that group. I have other folks in the District of Columbia that 
will be focusing on elections, so we are able to surge in to 
the space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="530" speaker="Mr. Krebs">That said, I can always do more--with more I can always do 
more. So we are continuing to work with our stakeholders to 
understand what it is they need from us, and then that refines 
our resource requirements.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="531" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, I am yielding 
back. I would ask the Secretary to think of an SOS number that 
could be given out as we move toward elections. If I am out in 
a field and somebody says I am totally collapsed and my local 
people can't find out why they are collapsed or what is going 
on, whether we should move to provisional, would be helpful to 
have that one SOS number.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="532" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="533" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Ms. Jackson Lee. With that, Mr. Secretary, will you take 
that under advisement, be able to say yes?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="534" speaker="Mr. Krebs">Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="535" speaker="Mr. Krebs">    Ms. Jackson Lee. All right, thank you very much. I yield 
back, thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman McCaul</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="536" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Gentlelady yields, I am going to think--
Ranking Member, I mean, closing. I would like to thank our 
witnesses for being here today, I just wanted to conclude with 
a short personal experience.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="537" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Over 20 years ago, I was a Federal prosecutor, Justice, and 
I prosecuted a guy named Johnny Chung who lead us to the 
Director of Chinese Intelligence, who was acting on behalf of 
China Aerospace because he liked then-President Clinton's 
position on technology transfers. He put money in to Johnny 
Chung's Hong Kong bank account to put in to the Presidential 
election.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="538" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So my point is, is that this is nothing new, foreign 
adversaries influencing our elections and Presidential 
elections. I think it has been going on for quite some time. I 
think now, they have found a new tool to use and manipulate to 
do that, and that is the internet and cyber space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="539" speaker="Chairman McCaul">So with that I want to thank both of you for your strong 
leadership on this issue. We take this very seriously in the 
Congress on both sides of the aisle as we enter into the mid-
term elections. If there's anything this committee can do to 
help you in your efforts, please let us know.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="540" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Members may have additional questions they may submit in 
writing, and pursuant to Committee rule VII(D) the hearing 
record will stay open for 10 days.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="541" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Without objection, committee stands adjourned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="542" speaker="Chairman McCaul">[Whereupon, at 12:38 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="543" speaker="Chairman McCaul">----------</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="544" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Questions From Honorable John Katko for Christopher C. Krebs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="545" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 1. Obviously, cybersecurity is a hot topic that many 
Government agencies have a piece of. But I think the one thing we 
learned after 9/11 was the potential damage that can be done when 
Government resources and intelligence are segmented and stove-piped. 
Can you speak to the importance of clarifying the roles and 
responsibilities of your directorate not only at the Department, but 
across the Federal Government to your ability to move this Nation 
toward more robust cybersecurity policies and practices?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="546" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. The Department has been provided clear roles and 
responsibilities authorized by several statutes passed in 2014 and 
2015, and are codified primarily in Title II of the Homeland Security 
Act (the Act); the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 
(CISA); and subchapter II, chapter 35 of title 44, U.S. Code, as 
created by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 
(FISMA). These functions are also supported by several important 
Executive branch documents, including Presidential Policy Directives 21 
and 41. These actions have furthered DHS's cybersecurity mission since 
its inception and codified interagency roles and responsibilities. 
Specifically, the Department placed the National Cybersecurity and 
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) within the DHS National 
Protection and Programs Directorate to serve as the round-the-clock 
operational center that executes the Department's cybersecurity and 
communications mission. The NCCIC is a lead civilian interface for 
sharing cyber threat information with the Government that is uniquely 
positioned as a sharing hub to integrate information from multiple 
sources, and use it to provide Government agencies and the private 
sector with actionable information to recognize, prevent, and mitigate 
harm from cyber attacks. As such, the NCCIC facilitates multi-
directional information sharing between the Federal Government and the 
private sector.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="547" speaker="Chairman McCaul">It is critical that Congress pass the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency Act in order to reinforce NPPD's role as 
currently performed. This law will establish a cybersecurity agency at 
the Department of Homeland Security to further National efforts to 
enhance the security and resilience of U.S. cyber and physical critical 
infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="548" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 2. Among the challenges that we face in cybersecurity is 
the pace at which our adversaries adapt their tactics, techniques, and 
procedures as we harden our own systems and networks. Are there any 
particular methods of attack or vectors of intrusion that DHS is 
focusing on during the upcoming election cycle?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="549" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. Many of the methods of attack and vectors of intrusion that 
DHS sees can be avoided through implementation of basic cyber hygiene 
mitigation efforts. As a result of malicious actors exploiting 
unpatched software, conducting phishing campaigns, and leveraging 
common vulnerabilities to pursue attacks against critical 
infrastructure organizations, we emphasize with the election community 
the myriad of attack vectors in order to increase the defense and 
resiliency of the election infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="550" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 3. Is NPPD being given access to all the necessary access 
to and information from the intelligence and law enforcement community 
to ensure you are in a position to accurately measure the risks to our 
election system? Can you say the same thing for the other sectors that 
have been designated critical infrastructure?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="551" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. To most effectively share information with all of our 
partners--not just those with security clearances--DHS works with the 
intelligence community to declassify relevant intelligence or provide 
tearlines as much as possible. While DHS prioritizes declassifying 
information to the extent possible, DHS also provides Classified 
information to cleared stakeholders, as appropriate.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="552" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Although more work is needed, DHS's goal is to ensure that law 
enforcement and the intelligence community are sharing all relevant 
information and that it is in a format that can be widely disseminated 
to critical infrastructure partners. This work is a vital part of our 
information-sharing efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="553" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Questions From Honorable John Ratcliffe for Christopher C. Krebs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="554" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 1. The Election System is just one part of the critical 
infrastructure security responsibilities that DHS has. Is there a need 
for each of these sectors to create their own cybersecurity information 
centers like the NCCIC or would such a splintering of Federal resources 
potentially harm the security of Nation?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="555" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. To break down information stovepipes and ensure cross-
sector approaches to protecting our Nation, the Department's specific 
cybersecurity authorities executed through NPPD--including authorities 
related to sharing, analyzing, and coordinating actionable information 
related to cybersecurity risks and incidents; protecting Federal 
information systems; and responding to cybersecurity incidents--enable 
NPPD to engage with Federal and non-Federal entities (i.e. all 
stakeholders--public, private, and international) and across and beyond 
all critical infrastructure sectors to collaboratively improve 
cybersecurity practices and protect Federal and non-Federal entities 
from cyber risks. While Sector-Specific Agencies have specific roles 
with respect to working with their stakeholders, DHS has the lead for 
understanding and providing cross-sector information, analysis, and 
protective measures to all sectors. If agencies work within stovepipes 
with their stakeholders, then other sectors are not afforded the 
critical information related to new attack vectors and identified 
vulnerabilities. Congress has taken specific action to overcome this 
challenge and clarify DHS's role to prevent stovepipes across critical 
infrastructure sectors. The Homeland Security Act was amended in 2014 
and 2015 to codify the role of the Department's National Cybersecurity 
and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) as the Federal-civilian 
interface for sharing information regarding cybersecurity risks and 
incidents and authorize the NCCIC to provide cybersecurity-related 
technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response 
capabilities to Federal and non-Federal entities. In a similar fashion, 
the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 also establishes the NCCIC as the Federal 
Government's central hub for sharing cyber threat indicators between 
the private sector and the Federal Government and requires the 
Department to establish the Federal Government's capability and process 
for sharing cyber threat indicators with both Federal and non-Federal 
entities. DHS operates a central hub for information exchange, 
technical expertise, operational partnerships, and systems-focused 
cybersecurity capabilities through the National Cybersecurity and 
Communications Integration Center.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="556" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Cross-sector coordination of the Federal Government's cybersecurity 
efforts is critical to our Nation's National security, economic 
security, public health, and safety. Information regarding situational 
awareness, vulnerability, and incidents must be shared as quickly as 
our adversaries move in cyber space.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="557" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 2. Can you speak to the importance of clarifying the roles 
and responsibilities of your directorate, not only at the Department, 
but across the Federal Government, for your ability to move this Nation 
towards more robust cybersecurity policies and practices?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="558" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
  Questions From Honorable James R. Langevin for Christopher C. Krebs</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="559" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 1a. On April 24, Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra 
testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs 
Committee that the surge in risk and vulnerability assessments for 
elections infrastructure created ``a significant backlog in other 
critical infrastructure sectors and Federal agencies'' waiting for 
similar assessments. The President's 2019 budget did not request an 
increase in resources sufficient to overcome this backlog.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="560" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Are more resources necessary to support the increased requests from 
State and local governments without delaying other assessments?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="561" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 1b. What is the current RVA backlog? What is the prognosis 
for that backlog over the next calendar year?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="562" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. Currently, about 28 critical infrastructure entities and 
Federal agencies have Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (RVAs) that 
have been scheduled at a later date due to the critical, time-sensitive 
prioritization of election-related RVAs. For the RVAs unrelated to 
elections, the wait time is at least 100 days for entities prioritized 
at the top of the list and indefinite for those at a lower priority. 
Federal agencies and entities in the chemical, emergency services, 
energy, financial services, Government facilities, transportation, 
water and wastewater, food and agriculture, defense industrial base, 
and information technology sectors have been impacted. The RVA queue is 
dynamic and reprioritized as part of a quarterly scheduling routine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="563" speaker="Chairman McCaul">With current resource capacity, the waiting list for RVAs cannot be 
eliminated. Federal agencies and critical infrastructure entities are 
regularly added to the schedule. To date 98 RVAs have been completed, 
of which 29 were Election-based RVAs. In fiscal year 2019, NPPD plans 
to conduct 90 RVAs, of which 30 will be performed on Federal High-Value 
Assets. The remaining 60 RVAs will be determined in accordance with our 
prioritization process and methodology.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="564" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 2a. Based on the RVAs that DHS has carried out for State 
and local election officials, do most States and localities have the 
resources required to sufficiently mitigate their cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities (including equipment, staffing, training, and other 
components that factor into security)?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="565" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 2b. If not, how big is the shortfall?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="566" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. Through the fiscal year Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) Appropriations Act and a reprogramming request, DHS was provided 
with approximately $26 million to support election infrastructure 
security activities. These additional funds have been covering a number 
of efforts to enhance the security and resilience of election 
infrastructure.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="567" speaker="Chairman McCaul">NPPD provides assistance to State and local election officials to 
help them determine where vulnerabilities may exist. However, decisions 
about how to resource election infrastructure security enhancements are 
made solely by those officials. Through the Election Assistance 
Commission, Congress recently made $380 million in funding available to 
State and local election officials to improve cybersecurity of Federal 
elections. The money is intended to provide an additional infusion of 
funding for new resources and personnel to improve Federal elections. 
Congressional support of funding for these activities is appreciated.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="568" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 3. In the guidance NPPD issued to election officials on 
how to spend security funding, NPPD emphasizes the importance of 
deploying auditable voting systems.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="569" speaker="Chairman McCaul">How important is it that States have auditable paper trails and 
conduct post-election audits to verify the digital tallies of election 
results?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="570" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. As noted in the prior question, through the Election 
Assistance Commission, Congress recently made $380 million in funding 
available to State and local election officials to improve the 
cybersecurity of Federal elections which will provide an additional 
infusion of funding for new resources and personnel to improve Federal 
elections.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="571" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Deploying auditable voting systems is critical to the resilience of 
the process and is being prioritized by many States. With the continued 
move to auditable systems, post-election auditing has become a common 
practice for many election jurisdictions. However, for many offices, 
the post-election audit process is time-consuming and costly. Improving 
the overall efficiency and effectiveness of post-election audits is a 
quick way to improve the overall integrity of the process. Simple steps 
like hiring more temporary staff to organize and run the post-election 
audit is an effective way to lessen the burden on already over-worked 
and under-staffed election offices while improving the overall 
resilience of the process.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="572" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Question 4. Much of DHS's mission requires close coordination with 
other agencies, especially with respect to cybersecurity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="573" speaker="Chairman McCaul">How has the Department's ability to synchronize its cyber mission 
with other agencies been affected by the elimination of the 
Cybersecurity Coordinator position and the recent high rate of turnover 
at the National Security Council?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="574" speaker="Chairman McCaul">Answer. Changes made within the National Security Council staff 
related to the Cybersecurity Coordinator have had no impact on DHS's 
ability to execute its mission. The President has provided clear 
direction to DHS and other National security agencies to execute our 
authorities and responsibilities. DHS and our interagency partners 
continue to coordinate regularly, through the National Security Council 
staff, on policy matters and our operational centers.</paragraph>
