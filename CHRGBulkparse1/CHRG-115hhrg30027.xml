    <info>    The Helsinki process, formally titled the Conference on Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe, traces its origin to the signing of the </info>
    <info>Helsinki Final Act in Finland on August 1, 1975, by the leaders of 33 </info>
    <info>European countries, the United States and Canada. As of January 1, </info>
    <info>1995, the Helsinki process was renamed the Organization for Security </info>
    <info>and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The membership of the OSCE has </info>
    <info>expanded to 56 participating States, reflecting the breakup of the </info>
    <info>Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia.</info>
    <info>    The OSCE Secretariat is in Vienna, Austria, where weekly meetings </info>
    <info>of the participating States' permanent representatives are held. In </info>
    <info>addition, specialized seminars and meetings are convened in various </info>
    <info>locations. Periodic consultations are held among Senior Officials, </info>
    <info>Ministers and Heads of State or Government.</info>
    <info>    Although the OSCE continues to engage in standard setting in the </info>
    <info>fields of military security, economic and environmental cooperation, </info>
    <info>and human rights and humanitarian concerns, the Organization is </info>
    <info>primarily focused on initiatives designed to prevent, manage and </info>
    <info>resolve conflict within and among the participating States. The </info>
    <info>Organization deploys numerous missions and field activities located in </info>
    <info>Southeastern and Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The </info>
    <info>website of the OSCE is: &lt;www.osce.org&gt;.</info>
    <info>    The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as </info>
    <info>the Helsinki Commission, is a U.S. Government agency created in 1976 to </info>
    <info>monitor and encourage compliance by the participating States with their </info>
    <info>OSCE commitments, with a particular emphasis on human rights.</info>
    <info>    The Commission consists of nine members from the United States </info>
    <info>Senate, nine members from the House of Representatives, and one member </info>
    <info>each from the Departments of State, Defense and Commerce. The positions </info>
    <info>of Chair and Co-Chair rotate between the Senate and House every two </info>
    <info>years, when a new Congress convenes. A professional staff assists the </info>
    <info>Commissioners in their work.</info>
    <info>    In fulfilling its mandate, the Commission gathers and disseminates </info>
    <info>relevant information to the U.S. Congress and the public by convening </info>
    <info>hearings, issuing reports that reflect the views of Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission and/or its staff, and providing details about the activities </info>
    <info>of the Helsinki process and developments in OSCE participating States.</info>
    <info>    The Commission also contributes to the formulation and execution of </info>
    <info>U.S. policy regarding the OSCE, including through Member and staff </info>
    <info>participation on U.S. Delegations to OSCE meetings. Members of the </info>
    <info>Commission have regular contact with parliamentarians, government </info>
    <info>officials, representatives of non-governmental organizations, and </info>
    <info>private individuals from participating States. The website of the </info>
    <info>Commission is: &lt;www.csce.gov&gt;.</info>

    <info>    Mr. Price. Good morning, everyone. I'll let people take a second to </info>
    <info>get seated. On behalf of our Chairman, Senator Roger Wicker, and Co-</info>
    <info>Chairman, Congressman Chris Smith, I want to welcome you to this U.S. </info>
    <info>Helsinki Commission briefing titled ``Democracy Deferred: The State of </info>
    <info>Elections and Fundamental Freedoms in Azerbaijan.'' I'm grateful for </info>
    <info>your presence with us this morning and extend my appreciation to all of </info>
    <info>those who are tuning in from around the world via our Facebook Live </info>
    <info>stream.</info>
    <info>    My name is Everett Price. I am the commission's policy advisor </info>
    <info>responsible for the Southern Caucasus region. The commission is </info>
    <info>convening this briefing this morning to assess the state of democracy </info>
    <info>and human rights in Azerbaijan today. As a participating State of the </info>
    <info>Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Azerbaijan, like </info>
    <info>the United States and over 50 other nations, has freely undertaken </info>
    <info>robust commitments in the fields of democratic principles and basic </info>
    <info>rights. Our commission is charged with monitoring the implementation of </info>
    <info>these commitments across Europe and Eurasia and informing American </info>
    <info>foreign policy toward the OSCE and its member States.</info>
    <info>    Regrettably, the actions of the Azerbaijani Government have given </info>
    <info>us cause for concern in recent years. At the start of his second decade </info>
    <info>in power, President Ilham Aliyev in 2013 tightened his regime's grip on </info>
    <info>national institutions, the political opposition, and independent press. </info>
    <info>Our commissioners closely followed these developments and drew </info>
    <info>attention to them. In December 2015, then-Commission Chairman </info>
    <info>Congressman Chris Smith introduced the Azerbaijan Democracy Act which, </info>
    <info>among other things, sought to impose strict travel bans and asset </info>
    <info>freezes on Azerbaijan's leadership until the government released </info>
    <info>political prisoners, ceased its harassment of the media and civil </info>
    <info>society, and demonstrated progress toward free, fair, and transparent </info>
    <info>elections.</info>
    <info>    Since the introduction of the Azerbaijan Democracy Act, the </info>
    <info>government has freed some political prisoners. But it has continued, </info>
    <info>and in some ways escalated, its clampdown on political activists and </info>
    <info>the press. What's more, the country has not held a single free and fair </info>
    <info>election. Quite to the contrary, President Aliyev staged a popular </info>
    <info>referendum in September 2016 that extended presidential terms from 5 to </info>
    <info>7 years and empowered himself to appoint his wife as vice president, </info>
    <info>unilaterally placing her at the top of the line of succession. Amidst </info>
    <info>widespread harassment of journalists and anti-referendum campaigners, </info>
    <info>the government reported that the sweeping constitutional changes were </info>
    <info>approved with around 90 percent of the vote.</info>
    <info>    2017 brought more worrying developments. Having, over the years, </info>
    <info>shuttered, co-opted, or otherwise censored all independent print, TV, </info>
    <info>and radio media, the government took the next step by blocking </info>
    <info>virtually all the country's major online sources of independent </info>
    <info>reporting, including Meydan TV, whose director is here with us this </info>
    <info>morning. There were also disturbing claims that the government has </info>
    <info>resorted to kidnapping independent journalists abroad. In September of </info>
    <info>last year, Congressman Smith and Congressman McGovern responded to </info>
    <info>these events by introducing a successor bill to the Azerbaijan </info>
    <info>Democracy Act, House Resolution 537. H. Res. 537 calls on the U.S. </info>
    <info>administration to pursue targeted human rights and religious freedom </info>
    <info>sanctions against Azerbaijani authorities.</info>
    <info>    Just last month, President Aliyev was re-elected to a 7-year term </info>
    <info>with more than 86 percent of the vote. The government fulfilled its </info>
    <info>commitment to invite the OSCE to observe the election and the </info>
    <info>observation mission conducted its work freely. Unfortunately, however, </info>
    <info>the international observers had a bleak story to tell. The OSCE's </info>
    <info>preliminary conclusions described a vote that ``lacked genuine </info>
    <info>competition'' amidst a ``restrictive political environment and legal </info>
    <info>framework that curtails fundamental rights and freedoms.''</info>
    <info>    Azerbaijan is an important partner for the United States in a </info>
    <info>sensitive and critical region. Our examination of Azerbaijan's human </info>
    <info>rights record is born out of this recognition. The United States holds </info>
    <info>its friends to a higher standard in the interest of fostering stable </info>
    <info>and enduring partnerships that are rooted in core values. As Azerbaijan </info>
    <info>prepares to mark 100 years of independence on May 28, it has the </info>
    <info>opportunity to open a new century by renewing its respect for the </info>
    <info>fundamental freedoms and dignity of its people. Our expert panel today </info>
    <info>will help us to take stock of this moment in Azerbaijani history, and </info>
    <info>the steps that are needed to begin charting a new path. With us today </info>
    <info>are distinguished experts in Azerbaijan in different aspects of this </info>
    <info>situation that we're examining.</info>
    <info>    First, we'll begin with Audrey Altstadt, a professor of history at </info>
    <info>the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. She is the author of numerous </info>
    <info>articles, op-ed essays, and three books, most recently ``Frustrated </info>
    <info>Democracy in Post-Soviet Azerbaijan,'' published by the Woodrow Wilson </info>
    <info>Center Press and Columbia University Press just last year in 2017. She </info>
    <info>is chair of the George F. Kennan Institute Advisory Council and has </info>
    <info>been a consultant to The Freedom House, Radio Liberty, U.S. Departments </info>
    <info>of State and Justice, other U.S. Government agencies, and the U.S. Army </info>
    <info>War College. She earned a doctorate from the University of Chicago and </info>
    <info>an honorary doctorate from Khazar University in Baku, Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Altstadt will help us with an overview of the situation facing </info>
    <info>democracy and elections in Azerbaijan. And then we'll move on to our </info>
    <info>other panelists who will discuss the situation regarding political </info>
    <info>prisoners as well as media freedom in the country. And without further </info>
    <info>ado, I will turn it over to Dr. Altstadt. Thank you for being here.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Altstadt. Thank you. I want to thank Everett and I want to </info>
    <info>thank the commission for the opportunity to be here and make these </info>
    <info>comments.</info>
    <info>    Azerbaijan's political profile in both law and practice continues </info>
    <info>to move away from democratic norms, as exemplified in its recent </info>
    <info>presidential election of April 11. The turn away from democracy has </info>
    <info>been apparent throughout most of the post-Soviet period, but has </info>
    <info>changed noticeably under Ilham Aliyev's presidency, since 2003. </info>
    <info>Although we often hear about the crackdown of 2014, I think that the </info>
    <info>pattern that it refers to actually began after the 2012 elections to </info>
    <info>the national assembly, because in that election the major opposition </info>
    <info>parties were sidelined, and the ruling party and its supporters gained </info>
    <info>a substantial majority in the national assembly. That control of the </info>
    <info>legislature was instrumental in centralizing control in the executive.</info>
    <info>    The tightening of controls in Azerbaijani politics is readily </info>
    <info>measurable in the electoral process. And so I'll begin briefly by </info>
    <info>mentioning a few points that come up with the recent OSCE ODIHR </info>
    <info>monitoring reports concerning the April 11 election. Those of you </info>
    <info>familiar with the OSCE process--probably most of you in this room--know </info>
    <info>that there are several reports for each election: a needs assessment </info>
    <info>report, an interim report prior to election day, a preliminary post-</info>
    <info>election report, and the final report. The last time I checked, which </info>
    <info>was last night, that was not yet up on the website. The election </info>
    <info>itself, as previously, was marked by ballot box stuffing, carousel </info>
    <info>voting, irregularities in polling stations and in counting. At the end </info>
    <info>of the day, the election campaign was deemed to have been not </info>
    <info>competitive. None of the candidates offered significant alternative </info>
    <info>views or criticism of current policies, or of the incumbent.</info>
    <info>    One of the strengths of the OSCE ODIHR reports--which I've used </info>
    <info>over the years and read every one with respect to Azerbaijan--is that </info>
    <info>they not only examine the applicable laws and the events of the actual </info>
    <info>day of voting, but they also examine the laws and the structures, the </info>
    <info>media environment, and the role of authorities prior to the election </info>
    <info>day, as well as other times. I want to draw attention to just a couple </info>
    <info>of points here. This is by no means an exhaustive list. First is the </info>
    <info>timing of the election in April 11. This was in and of itself an </info>
    <info>anomaly, because in the past, elections have been held in the fall, </info>
    <info>usually October or November. And indeed, this election also was </info>
    <info>originally scheduled for October. It was moved to April 11 only in </info>
    <info>February.</info>
    <info>    The reason for the abrupt change has been a subject of lots of </info>
    <info>speculation, most vocally, I suppose, the undercutting of the </info>
    <info>opposition. But the opposition has been so significantly sidelined by </info>
    <info>previous policies and practices that that doesn't seem like a real </info>
    <info>major reason to make such a sudden change. There was also discussion </info>
    <info>about Ilham having serious illness and needing to undergo medical </info>
    <info>treatment. I don't know whether any of these things are true, but I </info>
    <info>will return to this point at the end.</info>
    <info>    The second point in my thinking really has to do with how it is the </info>
    <info>election got moved in the first place. And this is related to another </info>
    <info>aspect of the OSCE ODIHR reporting, which is the larger, complex legal </info>
    <info>and constitutional issues, some of which Everett just talked about in </info>
    <info>his introduction--the constitutional amendments, more than 100 of them, </info>
    <info>which were rushed through in the summer of 2016, which then </info>
    <info>concentrated more power in the hands of the president.</info>
    <info>    A third aspect is the concentration of power in the ruling party in </info>
    <info>the national assembly. The ability to make changes in law and in </info>
    <info>conditions that allow for the ruling elite is really significant. First </info>
    <info>of all, with respect to elections, it means that YAP, the Yeni </info>
    <info>Azerbaycan Partiyasi, the ruling party, not only controls a third of </info>
    <info>the election commission, its other supporters control more than that. </info>
    <info>Therefore, it also controls all the lower level commissions. And it </info>
    <info>chairs all the commissions at all levels. Many of the opposition </info>
    <info>parties and opposition parliamentarians--used loosely in this </info>
    <info>instance--who are deputies of the national assembly are in fact nominal </info>
    <info>opposition. But they are actually regime supporters. This lock on the </info>
    <info>national assembly is what allows the assembly to introduce bills, </info>
    <info>debate them, and then implement them as if they were in fact a product </info>
    <info>of independent, elected action by an elected body, rather than a diktat </info>
    <info>of the regime. And this process is a charade.</info>
    <info>    A fourth point is the general environment in which the election </info>
    <info>took place. Constraints on the media, which others will talk about, and </info>
    <info>public demonstrations, which are constrained and sometimes quashed with </info>
    <info>the use of violence by the police. There is intimidation of potential </info>
    <info>participants, and sometimes just physically blocking access to </info>
    <info>demonstrations by closing streets or by closing subway stations. And </info>
    <info>these are significant because they are an important measure of civil </info>
    <info>society participation, which is essential in a democratic system. In </info>
    <info>the same way that many of the opposition parties are not really in the </info>
    <info>opposition, many of the so-called NGOs are actually GONGOs, or </info>
    <info>government-organized nongovernmental organizations. These are also a </info>
    <info>fiction.</info>
    <info>    And finally, one of the things which concerns me the most is the </info>
    <info>specific targeting of the younger generation, people that are 40 and </info>
    <info>under, those who have been shaped to the least degree by Soviet </info>
    <info>education and Soviet expectations.</info>
    <info>    There is a wider situation here, which is an important context for </info>
    <info>understanding political life, governance, and other issues in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. In Azerbaijan we are seeing democracy in form but not in </info>
    <info>substance. The regime uses the terminology of democracy, but in fact it </info>
    <info>establishes a system which it controls and shapes for the regime's own </info>
    <info>benefit. This is really the opposite of a democracy. And yet, the </info>
    <info>regime and its representatives insist that the form is the substance. </info>
    <info>There are supporters who make this argument. There are those who have </info>
    <info>been persuaded by gifts or lobbying from Azerbaijan. But there are </info>
    <info>groups that are not fooled. And the OSCE is one of those. The Venice </info>
    <info>Commission has not been fooled. The European Court of Human Rights has </info>
    <info>not been fooled.</info>
    <info>    The numerous rulings which the court has made against cases brought </info>
    <info>from Azerbaijan have been ignored in Baku. And even though the regime </info>
    <info>talks about conforming to its principles and of the Council of Europe, </info>
    <info>in fact when it comes right down to the actions, they violate these </info>
    <info>regularly. Late last fall, the Council of Europe finally stood up to </info>
    <info>the pressures of the regime and voted to potentially expel Azerbaijan </info>
    <info>from its membership in a multistep process that it is beginning. This </info>
    <info>infringement process would first begin with loss of voting rights. If </info>
    <info>it should take place, and if they should ultimately get to a point of </info>
    <info>expelling Azerbaijan or getting close to expulsion, this would be an </info>
    <info>enormous embarrassment for the regime. And the Aliyev regime certainly </info>
    <info>does not like to be embarrassed.</info>
    <info>    And this, in my mind, brings us back to the reason which I believe </info>
    <info>is a crucial reason for having moved the elections in the first place, </info>
    <info>and that has to do with the case of Ilgar Mammadov. And, again, my </info>
    <info>colleagues will talk more about this, but the European Court for Human </info>
    <info>Rights ruled that his 2013 conviction was, in fact, politically </info>
    <info>motivated and ordered that he be released. But he was not. The warnings </info>
    <info>were ignored. And in November 2017, there was a Council of Europe </info>
    <info>deadline which passed, not surprisingly that the regime, again, </info>
    <info>ignored. And then that's when the Council of Europe threatened to take </info>
    <info>these infringement steps.</info>
    <info>    Perhaps it is only coincidental that a few weeks later Azerbaijani </info>
    <info>law was changed to allow the president to move the date of elections, </info>
    <info>as long as they were within 60 days--or, more than 60 days from the </info>
    <info>date of setting. It was then about a month and a half after that that </info>
    <info>the elections were, in fact, rescheduled. I don't believe in </info>
    <info>coincidences, so I suspect that this is in fact a way to move the </info>
    <info>election to beat this multistep process by the Council of Europe and </info>
    <info>then, before they could take an action, release Ilgar Mammadov--too </info>
    <info>late for him to be a contender in the Presidential election, but in </info>
    <info>time to stop this action against Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    There is a notion that Azerbaijan is a good partner for the West </info>
    <info>and for the United States with respect to energy cooperation, military, </info>
    <info>and business opportunities. I'm well familiar with this explanation, </info>
    <info>and also the plea that Westerners should be fair and talk about the </info>
    <info>advances that this regime has in fact made in terms of rebuilding the </info>
    <info>infrastructure, finding housing for internally displaced persons </info>
    <info>(IDPs), improving the poverty rate in the country. I do acknowledge </info>
    <info>that. And I do, indeed, want to be fair. And to be further fair, I also </info>
    <info>want to point out that many of these infrastructural improvements were </info>
    <info>made in such a way that the companies that in fact carried them out are </info>
    <info>owned directly or indirectly by the first family and other oligarchs, </info>
    <info>allegedly, in conjunction with international reporting, which has taken </info>
    <info>place and discovered ownership of these various companies.</info>
    <info>    So in other words, the picture is indeed complex. I want to </info>
    <info>acknowledge that. I want to point out that we are talking about that. </info>
    <info>And in Azerbaijan, there really are stark differences between, let's </info>
    <info>say, those who have these opportunities to make money through tourism </info>
    <info>and construction, who have the ability to gain immense private wealth </info>
    <info>while some IDPs are still living in train cars. There are people whose </info>
    <info>children go to schools in Baku that are underfunded. They have to pay </info>
    <info>teachers just to get the grades the students earn, much less better </info>
    <info>grades. And then there are other people who, of course, send their </info>
    <info>children to school abroad, where they can live in condos in London or </info>
    <info>New York and go to private schools. So the gap between the rich and the </info>
    <info>poor, the haves and the have-nots, is very stark here.</info>
    <info>    The underlying argument that Azerbaijan is a good partner in some </info>
    <info>ways is not the argument I'm making. I'm making quite the opposite </info>
    <info>argument. I'm making the argument instead that the key function of </info>
    <info>government is to protect the individual, regardless of the individual's </info>
    <info>views or beliefs. And I think, speaking as a historian, that one thing </info>
    <info>we learn from the 20th century is that systems that repress individual </info>
    <info>human rights and human beings ultimately may look like they're good </info>
    <info>partners, but in the end make poor partners because they are ultimately </info>
    <info>untrustworthy.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Thank you very much for that insightful overview. That </info>
    <info>helps set the stage for the rest of our conversation.</info>
    <info>    Next, I'd like to turn to Maran Turner. She's the founding </info>
    <info>executive director of Freedom Now, a U.S.-based organization that works </info>
    <info>to eliminate politically motivated detention worldwide. Among its </info>
    <info>efforts is the individual representation of prisoners of conscience, </info>
    <info>working with pro bono counsel and NGO partners to provide legal </info>
    <info>assistance and targeted advocacy initiatives intended to secure the </info>
    <info>release of those arbitrarily detained. Freedom Now has worked </info>
    <info>extensively in Eurasia, and since 2010 has maintained active cases and </info>
    <info>projects in Azerbaijan. The rest of her bio is available in your </info>
    <info>folders.</info>
    <info>    So, Maran, thank you.</info>
    <info>    Ms. Turner. Thank you, Everett. And my thanks to the Helsinki </info>
    <info>Commission and to all of you. I'm delighted to see a room that has </info>
    <info>quite filled out. I know all of us here maintain a keen eye on what </info>
    <info>happens in Azerbaijan. And it's important to see such interest from you </info>
    <info>all as well.</info>
    <info>    Subject to my bio, as Everett just read, I'm going to speak about </info>
    <info>the situation pertaining to political prisoners in Azerbaijan, which is </info>
    <info>an ongoing and destabilizing trend that's ripped apart families and </info>
    <info>ripped apart the strong networks of civil society. As small as it was, </info>
    <info>it was a great hope for the future of that country. And as my </info>
    <info>colleague, Audrey, has spoken about, President Aliyev has really </info>
    <info>meticulously consolidated power around his family and a small cabal of </info>
    <info>loyal allies. And this is really what's provided the framework for the </info>
    <info>sheer scale of politically motivated imprisonment. It's what has made </info>
    <info>it possible to keep him insulated from criticism and from political </info>
    <info>threat. And true to the authoritarian's playbook, Aliyev and his close </info>
    <info>associates do this by maintaining a strict hold and exploiting primary </info>
    <info>institutions like the judiciary, law enforcement, and the media.</info>
    <info>    But it's the law enforcement and the judiciary that's been </info>
    <info>especially busy, since commencing a crackdown that began in earnest </info>
    <info>around 2011-2013. This intensified, quite famously, in 2014, when civil </info>
    <info>society was quite decapitated in the country, and the leaders of a </info>
    <info>dozen civil society organizations were arrested. This was after the </info>
    <info>government had implemented a series of NGO laws which, at the time, we </info>
    <info>suspected where they were going with that. But there was optimism late </info>
    <info>in 2015 and 2016, when about a dozen of these individuals had been </info>
    <info>released. And these were people that a lot of us paid close attention </info>
    <info>to, because they were people--journalists, lawyers, and human rights </info>
    <info>defenders--who we had worked with over the years, who had been bringing </info>
    <info>us cases of other political prisoners. And all of a sudden, they were </info>
    <info>in jail.</info>
    <info>    It meant a lot to us to advocate for their release. And we were all </info>
    <info>very heartened when we saw them released. But we were not operating </info>
    <info>under an illusion that change was coming. And in fact, the revolving </info>
    <info>door carried on. More arrests came. And many people actually were not </info>
    <info>released and stayed in prison, and still are. Today, there's around 140 </info>
    <info>to 160 political prisoners. This is actually more than the number that </info>
    <info>was reported in 2014, at the height of the crackdown. The people in </info>
    <info>prison are lawyers, journalists, activists, politicians. Since that </info>
    <info>time, since a number of them have been released, they've gone into </info>
    <info>exile. Even before those arrests, there were a number of people working </info>
    <info>in the country as journalists and human rights defenders who saw the </info>
    <info>writing on the wall and escaped.</info>
    <info>    Some came to the West. For the most part, they have been able to </info>
    <info>continue their advocacy from abroad. But as many can tell you, Emin as </info>
    <info>well, their family members have suffered on their behalf at home. </info>
    <info>Others went to neighboring Georgia. There are obvious drawbacks to </info>
    <info>activists. Even though they've been able to carry on their advocacy </info>
    <info>from abroad, they are not on the ground. And the government has been </info>
    <info>able and has done their level best to paint them as traitors who've </info>
    <info>escaped the country to go join outside forces.</info>
    <info>    One particularly egregious example I want to speak about, which </info>
    <info>Audrey touched on as well, is the case of Ilgar Mammadov. He's </info>
    <info>important for a couple reasons. One, he has been in jail since 2013, </info>
    <info>when he wrote a blog post dispelling a narrative that the government </info>
    <info>had been putting out and promoting with respect to a demonstration that </info>
    <info>had turned destructive. He was sentenced for essentially fomenting mass </info>
    <info>disorder and was imprisoned--and put in prison for 7 years. And he's </info>
    <info>still there. I don't think any of us expected this. There was a lot of </info>
    <info>international and local attention on his case in 2013, in 2014. When </info>
    <info>the other arrests came in 2014, Ilgar Mammadov's case continued to be </info>
    <info>on every short list I saw that was going to the State Department and to </info>
    <info>the European Union calling for his release.</info>
    <info>    As Audrey mentioned, he actually was subject to two European Court </info>
    <info>decisions, one with respect to the denial of his pre-trial release, and </info>
    <info>then also with respect to the government's failure to provide him with </info>
    <info>a fair trial. And what was notable on both those cases is that the </info>
    <info>European Court found a violation of Article 18, which is essentially </info>
    <info>political motivations on the part of the government. Again, Ilgar is </info>
    <info>still in prison. And, again, as Audrey mentioned, the infringement </info>
    <info>proceedings have been taken up by the European Court at the request of </info>
    <info>the Council of Ministers. Suspension or expulsion is possible. A few </info>
    <info>years ago, I don't think any of us in the international human rights </info>
    <info>community wanted that. We continued to maintain that having Azerbaijan </info>
    <info>in the Council of Europe, subject to the jurisdiction of the European </info>
    <info>Court, was critical. That being surrounded by discussions and a spirit </info>
    <info>of rule of law and democratic principles could only fare well in the </info>
    <info>long term.</info>
    <info>    Unfortunately, now I don't know that there's many that continue to </info>
    <info>hold that position. Reports have come out in recent years--most </info>
    <info>recently from the Parliamentary Assembly and the Council of Europe--</info>
    <info>that detail a level of corruption that is staggering and beyond, I </info>
    <info>think, even what people working inside the Council of Europe were </info>
    <info>already aware of. It seems now that rather than what people thought </info>
    <info>would be a democratizing impact, has actually been the opposite. That </info>
    <info>in fact, having Azerbaijan inside the Council of Europe unfortunately </info>
    <info>has been a corrupting force. To put this in context, Ilgar's petition </info>
    <info>or application at the European Court is actually just one of 2,000. </info>
    <info>There are 2,000 cases pending at the European Court against Azerbaijan. </info>
    <info>Last year the court decided 26 cases, found human rights violations of </info>
    <info>24 of them--violations related to rights to freedom from arbitrary </info>
    <info>detention, right to fair trial, and right to freedom of assembly and </info>
    <info>association.</info>
    <info>    I want to touch on a couple of things before I close. Among the </info>
    <info>cases that don't get enough attention, frankly, are the religious </info>
    <info>freedom cases. This issue has been made quite murky by the Azerbaijan </info>
    <info>Government which declares these individuals as extremists and under the </info>
    <info>influence of Iran. And while there are no doubt some radicals in the </info>
    <info>country, Iran has gained influence inside as well, and the Azerbaijani </info>
    <info>Government is secular, 60 percent of the prisoners of conscience on </info>
    <info>these lists are those who have been put in prison because of their </info>
    <info>independent practice of Islam, and their association with outspoken </info>
    <info>clerics that has been used as an impetus to imprison them.</info>
    <info>    The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has </info>
    <info>designated Azerbaijan as a tier two country, indicating that violations </info>
    <info>of religious freedom are systematic and ongoing. Best example of this </info>
    <info>is the so-called Nardaran raid in 2015, where a number of individuals </info>
    <info>associated with a group called the Muslim Unity Movement were arrested. </info>
    <info>They were charged with inciting violence. Their leaders have been </info>
    <info>horrifically treated and tortured. In fact, just last week there were </info>
    <info>reports of new beatings. This group has been well known to civil </info>
    <info>society in the country. In fact, they're not known for religious </info>
    <info>advocacy or even particularly political. They're actually more known </info>
    <info>for protesting the government's treatment and policies toward them, as </info>
    <info>well as their calls for a better social support system. If there's a </info>
    <info>lesson that we've learned in the war on terror, it's that branding </info>
    <info>innocent people, especially community leaders, as terrorists can lead </info>
    <info>to radicalization within the country. And while their pleas might fall </info>
    <info>on deaf ears in Baku, I can tell you that Tehran is all ears.</info>
    <info>    The final trend I want to touch on is Azerbaijan's transnational </info>
    <info>activities. As more and more dissidents have fled, the government's </info>
    <info>tentacles have spread out in search of them. Those in exile in the U.S. </info>
    <info>and Europe, as I mentioned, have mostly been left alone. Their family </info>
    <info>members have not. They're harassed. They're threatened. They're </info>
    <info>detained. And in neighboring Georgia there's been sufficient evidence </info>
    <info>that the Azerbaijani authorities have acted in that country almost as </info>
    <info>though it's their backyard. We, along with a couple of other </info>
    <info>organizations, did a trip to Georgia last summer, where we documented </info>
    <info>systematic instances of people being followed, surveilled, and directly </info>
    <info>threatened.</info>
    <info>    The most egregious, of course, is the May abduction of the </info>
    <info>journalist Afgan Mukharli, who was convicted, after being kidnapped, of </info>
    <info>illegal border crossing and having 10,000 euros on him, which is an </info>
    <info>illegal amount. Exactly 10,000. Not 9,000, not 11,000, but the exact </info>
    <info>amount of 10,000. He got 7 years. His wife, no longer feeling safe in </info>
    <info>Georgia, fled the country for another country in Europe. The Georgians </info>
    <info>are still ostensibly carrying out that investigation. As last I </info>
    <info>understood it, the Azerbaijanis were still denying them access to Afgan </info>
    <info>himself so that they could question him.</info>
    <info>    So to close, it's time for a new strategy on Azerbaijan. Since the </info>
    <info>time I've been working on the country, this regime has gotten more </info>
    <info>emboldened and more calculating. They've also become impervious to </info>
    <info>outside pressure, but at the same time more concerned with cultivating </info>
    <info>a sophisticated image. But this is an authoritarian kleptocracy. And a </info>
    <info>seat in the elite circles in Washington and London should not come so </info>
    <info>cheaply. Until they actually start to meet the standards that they </info>
    <info>profess to adhere to, they should be shunned. Until they stop their </info>
    <info>systematic campaign against civil society and address the impunity </info>
    <info>within their law enforcement ranks, they should be turned away.</info>
    <info>    It's time to start naming and shaming. It's not Azerbaijan that's </info>
    <info>committing human rights violations. It's people inside the government </info>
    <info>that are committing human rights violations. These are ministers. These </info>
    <info>are prosecutors. These are judges. These are police officers. And it's </info>
    <info>time to hold them to account or call on the authorities in Baku to hold </info>
    <info>them to account. This means we have to start talking more stick and </info>
    <info>less carrot. And that includes Global Magnitsky.</info>
    <info>    I'll leave it at that.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Thank you very much, Maran.</info>
    <info>    Now I'd like to turn to Emin Milli, managing director of Meydan TV, </info>
    <info>independent online media for Azerbaijan. Meydan TV has been launched </info>
    <info>from Berlin in 2013. It is reaching weekly around 10 percent of the </info>
    <info>entire population in Azerbaijan. From 2002 to 2004, Milli was </info>
    <info>coordinator of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. And prior to that, he </info>
    <info>was a coordinator of the International Republican Institute in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. Milli was sentenced in 2009 for 2\1/2\ years for his </info>
    <info>critical views about the government of Azerbaijan and spent about 17 </info>
    <info>months in jail. He has a master's degree in state, society, and </info>
    <info>development from the University of London School of Oriental and </info>
    <info>African Studies. We're grateful that he's here with us from across the </info>
    <info>Atlantic.</info>
    <info>    Thank you, Emin. Please go ahead.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Milli. Thank you very much for invitations. Thank you for </info>
    <info>coming. I really would like to apologize that what I will talk about </info>
    <info>now is not exactly the speech of a media manager, but more of a citizen </info>
    <info>of Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    On behalf of Ilgar Mammadov, who has been a candidate in </info>
    <info>presidential elections but was jailed and wasn't given this </info>
    <info>opportunity. On behalf of Giyas and Bayram, who just wrote graffiti on </info>
    <info>the monument of Heydar Aliyev, father of the current president, and got </info>
    <info>just for this 10 years in jail, and have been tortured. On behalf of </info>
    <info>the 2-years-old niece of Ordukhan, who is the most efficient and the </info>
    <info>greatest political activist who lives abroad now, who organized a lot </info>
    <info>of protests in front of embassies of Azerbaijan abroad. And for this, </info>
    <info>12 members of his family--his brothers, sisters, and even 2-years-old </info>
    <info>niece, Siljan [ph]--were detained. They were threatened. And the </info>
    <info>government used this as a weapon to silence him.</info>
    <info>    On behalf of Tural Aliyev, Ordukhan's 19-year-old nephew, who was a </info>
    <info>student at Baku State University and who was arrested just a week ago, </info>
    <info>again to target Ordukhan personally. On behalf of Ilkin Rustamzadeh, </info>
    <info>who is now for years in jail just for organizing peaceful protest </info>
    <info>against the crimes committed in the army of Azerbaijan against soldiers </info>
    <info>of Azerbaijan by the government of Azerbaijan. I will try to speak </info>
    <info>briefly on behalf of all these people, and millions of others who are </info>
    <info>silenced, who live in fear, who are robbed by their own government.</info>
    <info>    One hundred years ago, Azerbaijan created the first democratic </info>
    <info>republic in the Muslim world. This is the heritage of 10 million people </info>
    <info>living today in Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, 100 years later we feel </info>
    <info>ashamed. We're feeling the shame that now in the Caucasus, we're the </info>
    <info>only country that didn't manage to get rid of the criminal and the </info>
    <info>dictator, who usurped the power. And I accuse Ilham Aliyev of all the </info>
    <info>crimes, all the detailed reporting that Audrey Altstadt and Maran </info>
    <info>Turner just presented to you, all these crimes of falsifying elections, </info>
    <info>torturing people, kidnapping people of Azerbaijan from other </info>
    <info>countries--like Afgan Mukharli, investigative journalist who was </info>
    <info>publishing his investigations about Aliyev and his businesses in </info>
    <info>Georgia at Meydan TV.</info>
    <info>    All these crimes of torturing people in prisons of Azerbaijan, </info>
    <info>going after their relatives when they speak out against the regime </info>
    <info>abroad, stealing of billions and tens of billions of dollars that came </info>
    <info>to Azerbaijan within last two decades from selling oil and gas--all </info>
    <info>these crimes, these are not abstract crimes. These are very specific </info>
    <info>crimes. And the person who leads this gang--because I cannot call it a </info>
    <info>government--is Aliyev. You know, there has never been, since Aliyev </info>
    <info>came to power, any sort of legitimate elections. These are not </info>
    <info>elections.</info>
    <info>    When Vaclav Havel wrote in his essays, and in ``The Power of the </info>
    <info>Powerless,'' but also in other essays, that certain concepts that you </info>
    <info>are using, like democracy, or parliament, or freedom of assembly, rule </info>
    <info>of law--these concepts that are born in the West, and they have been </info>
    <info>developed and have certain meanings--when they're applied in </info>
    <info>authoritarian countries, like Azerbaijan today, they lose any meaning. </info>
    <info>So if we talk about elections, I cannot talk about elections in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan because elections do not exist in Azerbaijan as you </info>
    <info>understand it here.</info>
    <info>    This is very important for when we analyze. All these election </info>
    <info>observation missions, they lose their meaning because there is nothing </info>
    <info>to analyze. There is no legitimate process that is going on in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. So today I stand here and, again, on behalf of people of </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan, accuse Ilham Aliyev for stealing 2.5 billion U.S. dollars </info>
    <info>and allocating this in British offshore bank accounts, and using this </info>
    <info>money not just against people of Azerbaijan, but against Europe, </info>
    <info>European Union, and against the U.S. What have they been doing with </info>
    <info>this money? And this is just 2.5 billion dollars.</info>
    <info>    This money has been put in these accounts by companies linked to </info>
    <info>Aliyev's family, linked to the International Bank of Azerbaijan, linked </info>
    <info>to ministries of Azerbaijan. This was a top story in The Guardian and </info>
    <info>the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, OCCRP, </info>
    <info>investigated this. There is evidence from just 2012 till 2014, 2.5 </info>
    <info>billion U.S. dollars--just think about this. Three million dollars on </info>
    <info>average per day has been channeled from Azerbaijan to British offshore </info>
    <info>bank accounts to bribe European politicians, American politicians, </info>
    <info>journalists, the expert community.</info>
    <info>    When such American and European politicians talk about Aliyev as a </info>
    <info>friend or an ally--because there are such American politicians and </info>
    <info>European politicians who talk about Aliyev as an ally--you have to </info>
    <info>think about this. What Aliyev and his family have been doing now for </info>
    <info>decades is destroying and committing crimes not just against the people </info>
    <info>of Azerbaijan. They have been committing crimes against the United </info>
    <info>States of America, against European Union member States. The Council of </info>
    <info>Europe, in fact, just published a report--it's more than 200 pages--</info>
    <info>which exactly detailed how they have been spending these tens of </info>
    <info>millions and hundreds of millions.</info>
    <info>    They are bribing European politicians. Not just any politicians. </info>
    <info>Luca Volonte, who has been accused now of receiving more than 2 million </info>
    <info>euros from our government, he wasn't just any politician. He was leader </info>
    <info>of the faction of the European People's Party in the Parliamentary </info>
    <info>Assembly of the Council of Europe. Another case, CNN producer Eckart </info>
    <info>Sager. If you watch CNN, what CNN is doing? They are promoting this </info>
    <info>dictatorship. They are promoting this money, which is also coming from </info>
    <info>these offshore bank accounts. This money has been robbed from the </info>
    <info>people of Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    There has been a call to investigate how the Aliyev regime has also </info>
    <info>corrupted members of the EU Parliament. And I think it's time that the </info>
    <info>U.S. Congress investigates if and how Aliyev regime corrupts </info>
    <info>politicians, journalists, media, and the expert community in the U.S. </info>
    <info>Two former U.S. ambassadors are now on the payroll of the Aliyev </info>
    <info>regime. It's a shame. If I was an American, I would feel ashamed. It's </info>
    <info>not just about Azerbaijan. Aliyev became a symbol of corruption. It's a </info>
    <info>global symbol of corruption. Someone who commits crimes against his own </info>
    <info>people. Someone who is very effective.</info>
    <info>    Azerbaijan's a small country. For a small country, Aliyev is </info>
    <info>extremely effective in helping to spread narratives like Kremlin </info>
    <info>propaganda spreads around the world. What does Kremlin propaganda say? </info>
    <info>That the West is corrupt. It's in decadence. It's corrupting. </info>
    <info>Everything is relative. We have corruption. They have corruption. What </info>
    <info>do you want from us, right? This is exactly word for word what </info>
    <info>Azerbaijani state propaganda says every day to 10 million people in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan and around the world. It's not just the 10 million people </info>
    <info>living in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijanis are spread around the world.</info>
    <info>    So Aliyev is not a friend. He is an enemy. In my view, it is </info>
    <info>extremely important to talk about sanctions against Aliyev, because he </info>
    <info>is on the top of this criminal pyramid. He became a symbol. It became </info>
    <info>fashionable today to be a dictator, to be authoritarian. You know this </info>
    <info>here in the U.S. You know in Europe. Journalists are not just killed in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan anymore. They are killed in Europe. They're attacked in the </info>
    <info>U.S. And if you think, conservatives or Democrats, that just focusing </info>
    <info>on the U.S. will save the U.S., well, I have bad news for you.</info>
    <info>    The very reason that the frontlines of freedom of expression, </info>
    <info>democracy, freedom at large are not in this post-Soviet space anymore </info>
    <info>but, in Hungary, in Poland, in the U.S., in Britain, in France, is </info>
    <info>because for two decades European and American politicians thought that </info>
    <info>the best way to deal with people like Aliyev is to avoid escalation. </info>
    <info>Every time when some media outlet has been shut down, some politician </info>
    <info>has been killed, a political activist has been jailed, what was the </info>
    <info>reaction? Statements of `we're deeply concerned,' accepting the </info>
    <info>reality, signing more contracts, more business, energy issues, and </info>
    <info>security issues.</info>
    <info>    All this backfired, because you have to understand, leaders like </info>
    <info>Aliyev, they have this gangster mentality. Aliyev doesn't say anything </info>
    <info>bad about Russia or Putin. He himself and his entire propaganda use </info>
    <info>very tough language against Europe and against the U.S. They shut down </info>
    <info>Radio Liberty in Azerbaijan. Even Putin didn't shut down Radio Liberty </info>
    <info>in Moscow. He thinks that these are weak leaders. They cannot do </info>
    <info>anything to him. He can bribe American and European politicians into </info>
    <info>accepting his way of life.</info>
    <info>    It's not just his way of life. This is the way of life and thinking </info>
    <info>supported by all dictators around the world. And this is coming to your </info>
    <info>home. This is in the U.S. now. This is in Europe now. If you are Le Pen </info>
    <info>and if you are supported by another dictatorship, you can go to the </info>
    <info>bank and take millions to fund your campaign. Now, show me the bank </info>
    <info>where you can go if you want to become president of Russia, if you want </info>
    <info>to become president of Uzbekistan, if you want to become a president of </info>
    <info>any other dictatorship--to fight against a dictatorship. Is there any </info>
    <info>bank you can go and take so much money?</info>
    <info>    So dictators became, like Aliyev, again, much more creative. The </info>
    <info>entire global civil society infrastructure of supporting freedom--we </info>
    <info>have to accept it--became more outdated. I really would like to thank </info>
    <info>the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Chris Smith personally, many congressmen </info>
    <info>and people in the U.S. Government and in Europe, who understand this </info>
    <info>and try to put, for example, Azerbaijani officials on the sanction list </info>
    <info>and who try to put Russian officials who violate human rights in Russia </info>
    <info>on the sanction list.</info>
    <info>    But unfortunately, this is not mainstream political decisionmaking. </info>
    <info>You know, much more needs to happen. So, again, I would like really to </info>
    <info>repeat that it is extremely important to personally put Ilham Aliyev on </info>
    <info>this sanctions list to show, for example, not just to Azerbaijan, not </info>
    <info>just to send a message around the world, but also to send a message </info>
    <info>here in the U.S., at this difficult time, to show people in the U.S. </info>
    <info>and around the world, what the U.S. is really about. That it's about </info>
    <info>values. It's about democracy. It's about human rights. And if you stop </info>
    <info>promoting this abroad, you will have these problems at home.</info>
    <info>    Thank you very much. [Applause.]</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Emin, for your </info>
    <info>powerful words and testimony, as you said, on behalf of people in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    I want to take just a few moments in my prerogative as the </info>
    <info>moderator to ask a couple questions before turning over the floor to </info>
    <info>the audience for your questions as well. First, I'd like to address the </info>
    <info>question of the opposition, which some of you touched on. Obviously, </info>
    <info>the opposition that participates within the parliament, as you said, </info>
    <info>Audrey, is not a legitimate one or a credible one. But there are </info>
    <info>genuine opposition movements that exist in Azerbaijan. And all of you, </info>
    <info>I think, discussed how many of them have fled the country and now exist </info>
    <info>in the diaspora.</info>
    <info>    Could you--from each of your perspectives--address what are the </info>
    <info>main opposition groups and what is the state of them now? And to what </info>
    <info>extent and how are they constrained and controlled by the government?</info>
    <info>    Dr. Altstadt. Okay. Well, one of the most potentially significant </info>
    <info>is the REAL Alternative--REAL, with which Ilgar Mammadov is associated. </info>
    <info>I'm saying that it is potentially influential because all the </info>
    <info>organizations that function or try to function inside of Azerbaijan are </info>
    <info>very sharply constrained in ways that my colleagues have both mentioned </info>
    <info>in terms of direct attacks on them or pressure on their families in and </info>
    <info>outside the country. One of the distinguishing features of REAL is that </info>
    <info>it tends to be a younger generation. It's that generation of people 40 </info>
    <info>and under who have not been as significantly shaped by Soviet system </info>
    <info>expectations, education, and so on, as the older generation had been.</info>
    <info>    I think that Aliyev and his group are, I believe, especially </info>
    <info>fearful of the younger group because there are lots of groups of young </info>
    <info>activists who are involved in all of the assorted color revolutions, </info>
    <info>so-called, starting with Georgia, which took place right next door when </info>
    <info>he first came to the presidency in 2003. And I think that that probably </info>
    <info>felt to him like the shot across the bow. I think that's potentially </info>
    <info>one of the most significant ones.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Sorry, could you also address the opposition's </info>
    <info>participation or non-participation in the election? Was that a decision </info>
    <info>that was taken by the opposition? Were they constrained by the timing </info>
    <info>of the election as well? I know you talked about it a little bit, but I </info>
    <info>was wondering if you could expand on it.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Altstadt. Because the major opposition parties are the older </info>
    <info>parties with the older leadership, they've been effectively </info>
    <info>marginalized. Their offices that used to be downtown are now out in </info>
    <info>little rust-bucket suburbs and so on. They don't have the resources, </info>
    <info>they don't have the means to maintain a regular network. So for them, </info>
    <info>having a long time to prepare to contest elections, such as they are, </info>
    <info>is really essential for them. And so rather than try to scramble and </info>
    <info>put together with their minimal resources, their small networks, and so </info>
    <info>on something relatively last minute, I think that was a key reason why </info>
    <info>they decided to boycott.</info>
    <info>    Another reason, of course, as Emin mentioned, you really can't talk </info>
    <info>about elections in the way that we understand them in a Western </info>
    <info>country. And the opposition still understands this. The Milli Shura, </info>
    <info>the national council, has said these kinds of things. And so there's a </info>
    <info>sense of `what's the point?' If we can't get out there and make our </info>
    <info>points, make our arguments, get ourselves into the public eye, then the </info>
    <info>next-best strategy is probably a boycott. And if they were not already </info>
    <info>so weakened and so constrained, there might have been other </info>
    <info>possibilities for them.</info>
    <info>    Of course, the additional problem, I suspect, is that lots of them </info>
    <info>are potentially discouraged. They've been fighting this fight for a lot </info>
    <info>of decades and they don't have any opportunity to move forward. So I </info>
    <info>think these components go into their thinking.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Emin, want to say a few words on that?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Milli. Yes. Regarding the opposition, well, again, it depends </info>
    <info>how you define opposition. There is no opposition in a sense that you </info>
    <info>understand opposition here in the U.S., because there is no condition. </info>
    <info>Opposition in the U.S. is a part of a system. It's part of how this </info>
    <info>country is run. This is not the case in Azerbaijan. Aliyev has created </info>
    <info>such a system that opposition is branded 24/7 on the entire pro-</info>
    <info>government TV as enemies of the people, enemies of the state, all the </info>
    <info>time. These are people who are killed, jailed, tortured, forced into </info>
    <info>exile, travel ban is imposed on them. So you cannot talk about </info>
    <info>opposition.</info>
    <info>    You have a group of citizens--various groups, individuals--who are </info>
    <info>not giving up the fight inside of the country and outside of the </info>
    <info>country. And I am actually optimistic about the prospects of change in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan, because REAL is one of the political groups who potentially </info>
    <info>has power to lead the change when the situation is right. So there are </info>
    <info>a lot of very educated, very talented experts, and politicians. This is </info>
    <info>another argument that kills everything that the government propagates </info>
    <info>inside and outside of the country, that there is no one except Aliyev </info>
    <info>who can run the country. This is just a lie.</info>
    <info>    There are also, you know, quite experienced, again, expert </info>
    <info>community inside and outside of Azerbaijan. There is a new phenomenon </info>
    <info>of bloggers and activists abroad. As Maran explained, many people had </info>
    <info>to flee. For example, Ordukhan is one of the most effective </info>
    <info>communicators and political activists who lives in the Netherlands. He </info>
    <info>communicates, alone, with 1 million people every week. Some of his </info>
    <info>videos get hundreds, thousands of views. He is not alone. There are </info>
    <info>several other bloggers like him. If Meydan TV communicates every week </info>
    <info>with 1 million people, people like Ordukhan alone communicate with </info>
    <info>hundreds, thousands, and up to 1 million and sometimes more than 1 </info>
    <info>million people inside of Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    This has never been the case before. And I ask myself a question: </info>
    <info>If people of Azerbaijan are so happy about this development and </info>
    <info>stability as Aliyev and his propaganda states, then why would people </info>
    <info>watch Ordukhan or Meydan TV or other bloggers who basically expose </info>
    <info>corruption, expose how the government and its officials treat ordinary </info>
    <info>citizens, the people's social problems, what people are facing. The </info>
    <info>reason why Meydan TV is popular is because we are just showing how </info>
    <info>people are living their everyday lives. That is the most popular </info>
    <info>content we have.</info>
    <info>    But when we show who is really vice president, the wife of the </info>
    <info>current president, Mehriba Aliyeva, just one video gets 1.5 million </info>
    <info>views, which is 15 percent of the entire population of Azerbaijan. When </info>
    <info>we showed a video of Ilham Aliyev's old and rotten team, 1 month ago we </info>
    <info>published such a video, it had 800,000 views, which is 8 percent of the </info>
    <info>population. And by the way, I think president and his team watched it, </info>
    <info>because recently Aliyev actually did appoint five younger and more </info>
    <info>educated ministers.</info>
    <info>    So my point is, there is genuine movement inside and outside of </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. And Azerbaijan doesn't live in a vacuum. I told you about </info>
    <info>the history, heritage of this country. And despite all the attacks, </info>
    <info>organizing against people inside and outside of Azerbaijan, this </info>
    <info>movement is growing. It has never faded away. And the people are </info>
    <info>gathering their courage and have no doubt, there are millions of </info>
    <info>unhappy people in Azerbaijan who are waiting for the moment to show up </info>
    <info>in the street and get rid of Aliyev. So this will happen. It's a matter </info>
    <info>of time.</info>
    <info>    And in my view, policymakers here in U.S. and in Europe, the </info>
    <info>European Union, they shouldn't sit and do nothing and just get </info>
    <info>surprised when things change in Armenia, or get surprised when </info>
    <info>everything changes in Ukraine, or get surprised when things change in </info>
    <info>Georgia, or in other dictatorships. They must start believing in the </info>
    <info>values on which United States of America is based, what made America </info>
    <info>great. You really have to believe in this. And you have to integrate it </info>
    <info>in your policies abroad as well, in regard to dictators like Aliyev as </info>
    <info>well.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. And Emin, could you also address the state of access to </info>
    <info>information inside of Azerbaijan? I know your outlet has been blocked </info>
    <info>by the government. Does it remain blocked? What other outlets are </info>
    <info>blocked? What's the state of independent media within Azerbaijan?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Milli. Well, the government monopolizes the entire TV, this </info>
    <info>classical TV infrastructure in Azerbaijan. They like to make </info>
    <info>statements. This is Aliyev's take at every Davos, at every forum that </info>
    <info>there is internet freedom in Azerbaijan. We have to understand that, </info>
    <info>Ordukhan can say later what is internet freedom. Even from the </info>
    <info>Netherlands--and the government tries to stop him in that by attacking </info>
    <info>his relatives and people who speak up on the internet. They are </info>
    <info>arresting and torturing people who write Facebook statuses. They </info>
    <info>blocked Meydan TV's website, Radio Liberty Azerbaijan Service website, </info>
    <info>Tehran TV website, Azadliq newspaper website, and many others. They are </info>
    <info>trying to block the information. They are not succeeding. They don't </info>
    <info>understand it. They have even shut down the entire internet.</info>
    <info>    And this is my message to policymakers here in D.C., and also to </info>
    <info>the government of Azerbaijan. All of you have to understand. In last 5 </info>
    <info>years--Meydan TV is a great example--they have been threatening me </info>
    <info>personally with this. They have been jailing my relatives. They have </info>
    <info>kidnapped our journalists. They blocked our website. They attacked us </info>
    <info>in every possible way. But every year, we just doubled our audience. So </info>
    <info>these repressions have never worked, and they will not work. So the </info>
    <info>only problem we actually have to grow and reach 60-70 percent of people </info>
    <info>in Azerbaijan is not Aliyev's repressions, it's our lack of resources.</info>
    <info>    My entire thinking now is can we actually create more resources so </info>
    <info>we can hire more journalists within and outside of Azerbaijan, citizen </info>
    <info>journalists--we have a huge network of citizen journalists. People in </info>
    <info>every corner of Azerbaijan feeding--sending us videos. The people </info>
    <info>became journalists, you know, because they jailed, killed, stopped, and </info>
    <info>silenced so many journalists. So the citizens became journalists. It's </info>
    <info>even more powerful than any media could ever imagine.</info>
    <info>    So they are trying, of course, to stop access to information. But </info>
    <info>the thing is, this is the problem for dictatorships, the more they try </info>
    <info>to close the free space, the more hunger for freedom they create, and </info>
    <info>the more people are interested in having more freedom and working for </info>
    <info>this and sacrificing for this. So this is what they tried. But they are </info>
    <info>failing. And I think the policymakers here have to understand these </info>
    <info>trends. They shouldn't be behind the trends. You know, they should be </info>
    <info>on top of those trends.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. And, Maran, could you discuss a little bit more about </info>
    <info>the restrictions that NGOs face, and religious organizations, as you </info>
    <info>mentioned in your testimony?</info>
    <info>    Ms. Turner. Sure. Well, as many of you in the room are probably </info>
    <info>aware--and I touched on in my opening remarks--there was a series of </info>
    <info>NGO laws that were passed a few years ago. This was not unique to </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. This was a wave that we were seeing across the region. And </info>
    <info>laws of these types have actually been in various countries, like India </info>
    <info>and China, for a long time. But what we saw was a real enthusiasm, </info>
    <info>particularly in Eurasia and especially in Azerbaijan. And they </info>
    <info>essentially implemented a series of laws that required organizations to </info>
    <info>register with the ministry of justice, and then also required them to </info>
    <info>register any grants they received. And what NGOs found when they tried </info>
    <info>to comply with these requirements, was that they couldn't get </info>
    <info>registered, that in fact there would be lots of delays, or the </info>
    <info>registration would be lost, et cetera.</info>
    <info>    So many of them were just, frankly, not able to register. And then </info>
    <info>even in some cases where they had registered, and even tried to </info>
    <info>register grants they were receiving, it didn't matter. These laws were </info>
    <info>passed with a real purpose in mind, and it was to really go after the </info>
    <info>leaders of civil society organizations. The cases that were brought </info>
    <info>against these individuals, bizarrely, were actually combined in one </info>
    <info>large case, I believe it had the same case number. And in the same </info>
    <info>case, they went after international organizations like Radio Free </info>
    <info>Europe and, I think, Open Society, and a few others. And the </info>
    <info>prosecutions, as well, were just identical--completely identical. The </info>
    <info>exact same allegations, which included abuse of office and illegal </info>
    <info>entrepreneurship. And these were also levied against Khadija </info>
    <info>Ismayilova, for example, who was with Radio Free Europe. But she wasn't </info>
    <info>running the office. So it was just a bizarre allegation against her. </info>
    <info>And it showed that they really weren't trying that hard.</info>
    <info>    These laws are still in force. And this is why so many people had </info>
    <info>fled the country and are working from outside of the country. And this </info>
    <info>is, frankly, why Tbilisi, I think, has really come to the forefront of </info>
    <info>the Azerbaijani authorities. I mean, I think that they have been </info>
    <info>seeking dissidents out in Georgia for a long time and harassing people. </info>
    <info>But in recent years, because so many people have been using it as a </info>
    <info>base and the authorities weren't able to get their hands on them in </info>
    <info>Baku, they just walked straight across the border and went to Tbilisi. </info>
    <info>So they're moving further afield. As Emin astutely pointed out, this </info>
    <info>has greatly frustrated civil society. But it hasn't ridden the regime </info>
    <info>of them. They are still working. And again, as Emin said, there's </info>
    <info>plenty of journalists still working inside the country. It's a very </info>
    <info>encouraging sign to see how many people are still in that fight, and I </info>
    <info>hope that continues. And I know that they've got a lot of support from </info>
    <info>the individuals in exile.</info>
    <info>    And the situation's probably even more dim for their religious </info>
    <info>groups. There are so many laws that the government has passed that </info>
    <info>really allow them to harass just innocent people practicing </info>
    <info>independently of the state. And they use those laws to put people in </info>
    <info>prison, not just leaders that are organizing but also just </info>
    <info>practitioners and people that are particularly associated with clerics </info>
    <info>that are outspoken. And as I said, they're generally not political. </info>
    <info>This is usually much more social. Azerbaijan has followed that trend, </info>
    <info>where once upon a time it was generally just fabricated charges like </info>
    <info>drug charges, hooliganism, and whatnot. In recent years they've really </info>
    <info>started to, in some ways, follow the path of rule of law, ironically--</info>
    <info>which is to say instead of just making stuff up, pass some laws that </info>
    <info>are just Byzantine and almost impossible to dissect and understand, and </info>
    <info>then just apply them, across the board and with little attention to how </info>
    <info>they're actually applying those laws.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Thank you. I'd like to give the audience an opportunity </info>
    <info>to ask questions. Edwin here will pass around the microphone to anybody </info>
    <info>who's interested. I think we have a hand here in the back. If you'll </info>
    <info>wait for the microphone just for a second, because that way the folks </info>
    <info>on Facebook Live can hear as well.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. My name is Abdullah Skarov [ph]. Just a few days ago, </info>
    <info>former U.S. Ambassador Richard Kauzlarich expressed his concern on </info>
    <info>social network and shared an article from the Israeli newspaper </info>
    <info>Haaretz. And I think the title of the article speaks for itself. It </info>
    <info>says how Israeli Jewish lobby groups in Capitol Hill are used by </info>
    <info>Azerbaijani Government as a secret weapon. And considering two sorts of </info>
    <info>Israel--oil is coming from Azerbaijan and multibillion dollar huge arms </info>
    <info>deals with Israel, and most recent escalating conflict with Iran, many </info>
    <info>Azerbaijani people believe this kind of inconsistent calls for </info>
    <info>sanctions or hearings, at best, are lip service or, worse, it's used </info>
    <info>after every big impact--thing like elections or huge oil contracts--to </info>
    <info>put the pressure--to buildup a pressure on the government to extract </info>
    <info>concessions. So what's your take on this?</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Well, I would say from the U.S. Helsinki Commission's </info>
    <info>perspective, I think I laid out in my opening remarks the consistency </info>
    <info>of our focus in light of the developments in Azerbaijan. Obviously, we </info>
    <info>respond to developments, we monitor commitments, and we highlight </info>
    <info>concerns where they exist. And that's been our practice, especially </info>
    <info>since the crackdown that began around 2013 and 2014. And we're here </info>
    <info>having this hearing in order to continue doing so.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Just one small additional. Emin Milli mentioned about </info>
    <info>corruption. There's multibillion-dollar corruption and violence. There </info>
    <info>are federal officials, local officials. Where this money's going? This </info>
    <info>multibillion dollars is usually siphoned out of the country. And in </info>
    <info>this case, it's reflected on arms deals, so are these arms deals with </info>
    <info>Israel. So the money is not staying in Azerbaijan. Nobody talks about </info>
    <info>these Jewish lobby groups in D.C. No one talks about where this money </info>
    <info>goes. They just inconsistently point fingers at the Azerbaijani </info>
    <info>Government.</info>
    <info>    These sanction calls have been on the floor before. Where did it </info>
    <info>end up? They are not consistent. They go nowhere. It is just coming </info>
    <info>after elections, these hearings, these talks, good, it's closed. And, </info>
    <info>again, another oil contract. Some talks here and it's closed. And my </info>
    <info>thought is, where this is going. Are you consistent with your sorts of </info>
    <info>opinions on these human rights issues? Many people believe democracy in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan is sacrificed. It's not a priority for U.S., as they are </info>
    <info>just used as a tool.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Milli. So I think everything Abdullah [sp] said is legitimate. </info>
    <info>And this is unfortunately the reality of global politics today, and not </info>
    <info>just in regard to Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    But I want to make just one point, which is very important for </info>
    <info>audience here and audience back in Azerbaijan who are watching us live. </info>
    <info>In my view, it is, first of all, for the people of Azerbaijan, for the </info>
    <info>citizens of Azerbaijan to change the situation in Azerbaijan, to change </info>
    <info>the government, to keep the president and all these corrupt officials </info>
    <info>in Azerbaijan accountable. So this is first of all a mission of the </info>
    <info>people in Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    And everyone in Azerbaijan should understand this. Because unless </info>
    <info>we care about our own problem and we actually show the world by showing </info>
    <info>up, 1 million people on the streets, and demanding freedom and justice </info>
    <info>in Azerbaijan, why should the Israeli lobby care? Why should U.S. </info>
    <info>congressmen care? Why should the U.S. Government care? Of course, I'd </info>
    <info>make the argument that they should care, but to be honest with you--and </info>
    <info>I think everyone in Azerbaijan should be honest with himself or </info>
    <info>herself--that it is, first of all, our problem. Unless we change, </info>
    <info>unless we show courage and show criminals who are unfortunately </info>
    <info>occupying our government their place in history, this will not change </info>
    <info>much, unfortunately.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Altstadt. We hear a lot about the U.S. Government does or </info>
    <info>doesn't do that, or a government does or doesn't do that. Government-</info>
    <info>to-government relations do matter. But it is also important to </info>
    <info>recognize that there are groups and factions within governments and </info>
    <info>within societies in and out of government that are really working to </info>
    <info>support dictatorships. And there are those that are fighting against </info>
    <info>those dictatorships, and they're trying to promote democracy and human </info>
    <info>rights in whatever ways that they're able to do that. And so in a </info>
    <info>sense, this case we're looking at today happens to be Azerbaijan, </info>
    <info>because we all work on Azerbaijan and that's our focal point.</info>
    <info>    But in the same way that dictators learn from one another across </info>
    <info>international borders, the human rights community and the pro-democracy </info>
    <info>community supports each other and they learn from each other as well. </info>
    <info>The lines are not only inside of individual countries, although they </info>
    <info>are and they must be, but there's really a much more international, a </info>
    <info>global division between people who favor dictatorships and favor </info>
    <info>supporting dictatorships by saying, oh, we can work with these people--</info>
    <info>which sounds chillingly like the 1930s.</info>
    <info>    And then there's the other faction that says, no, we don't accept </info>
    <info>all of that. We're interested in the ideals of democracy and human </info>
    <info>rights, even though countries that support those may do so imperfectly. </info>
    <info>And so the real question is, which side are you going to be on?</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. I think we have a question up here in front.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. My name is Ordukhan Teymurkhan. As Emin Milli said, I </info>
    <info>am a political activist and video blogger in Azerbaijan, but I'm </info>
    <info>abroad. And as he told you, my family is regularly, in the last 3 </info>
    <info>years, getting terrorized--I would say terrorized by the Azerbaijani </info>
    <info>Government. And as Emin Milli said, the accusations are going on Aliyev </info>
    <info>himself, Ilham, because I know a hundred percent all the orders are </info>
    <info>given by himself. And I would say thank you very much for Helsinki </info>
    <info>Commission that you are organizing these kind of discussions about the </info>
    <info>corruption and dictatorship of Aliyev.</info>
    <info>    But at the same time, some European countries and even the U.S. </info>
    <info>Government is playing double games. For example, about the sanctions--</info>
    <info>everybody knows that Aliyev, himself and his family is corrupt hundred </info>
    <info>percent, because even in The Guardian 2 weeks ago, in the newspaper </info>
    <info>they put that the two daughters of Aliyev, Leyla and Arzu, invested 110 </info>
    <info>million euros in Dubai for one palm island. They both want an island, </info>
    <info>and on one island, more than 20 houses. Why? Why can't the European </info>
    <info>countries and the U.S. Government put sanctions on these corrupt </info>
    <info>families? And they have to start from Aliyev, Aliyev himself, and then </info>
    <info>the other ministers and judges, as he said. And even they didn't say </info>
    <info>anything about when Ilham Aliyev appointed his wife as a vice </info>
    <info>president. And the European--in the countries, in the Western </info>
    <info>countries, democratic countries said nothing about these things.</info>
    <info>    And the elections--in one hand, in European countries we say we </info>
    <info>support democracy and human rights and we support only the humanity. </info>
    <info>And the elections in Azerbaijan, after the elections, everybody knew </info>
    <info>that he got 68 percent of votes. Can you imagine? And in one country </info>
    <info>even--no one is getting this kind of percentage in the elections. And </info>
    <info>in Venezuela, Europe--the U.S. Government didn't support the elections </info>
    <info>because the same happened in Venezuela as in Azerbaijan. And one day </info>
    <info>Aliyev comes and says, okay, the elections will be in April. And after </info>
    <info>the elections, the U.S. Government, even Trump, the President of the </info>
    <info>U.S., he sends a letter, congratulates Aliyev and says we are going to </info>
    <info>walk with you together, Mr. Aliyev. Why? Why not with Venezuela and </info>
    <info>with Aliyev as well?</info>
    <info>    I am very disappointed I couldn't speak as a speaker. As Emin said, </info>
    <info>1 million people watch me in Azerbaijan and if there are four or five </info>
    <info>people, who can change the country in Azerbaijan, I am one of them. I </info>
    <info>may be exaggerating. I could speak and tell my people that we have to </info>
    <info>do it ourselves, but the democratic countries like the U.S. and the </info>
    <info>European countries have to give us, the Azerbaijani people, support--</info>
    <info>not the dictator Aliyev, because of oil and money.</info>
    <info>    I'm sorry for my long speech.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Well, thank you for coming, and glad we have this </info>
    <info>opportunity to open the floor to the audience and to that sort of </info>
    <info>participation and to hear voices from the Azeri community.</info>
    <info>    I think there is a lot of interest here in sanctions. I was going </info>
    <info>to leave a question about sanctions more toward the end, but given the </info>
    <info>previous two questions I think it is fitting to discuss it now. There's </info>
    <info>been discussion of Global Magnitsky. Obviously, Global Magnitsky has </info>
    <info>provisions for travel bans and asset freezes for egregious human rights </info>
    <info>violations and also for levels of high corruption in the government.</info>
    <info>    I was wondering if the panel would perhaps like to talk about if </info>
    <info>there are ongoing efforts to pursue sanctions by the NGO community </info>
    <info>since NGOs have the ability to provide leads and information and </info>
    <info>evidence to the Department of State and to our Treasury Department. And </info>
    <info>also what obstacles they believe stand in the way to the application of </info>
    <info>sanctions against Azerbaijan?</info>
    <info>    Ms. Turner. I guess I'm the first to use the term Global Magnitsky, </info>
    <info>so I should speak. In short, the answer to your question is yes, there </info>
    <info>certainly are conversations among organizations here in Washington--and </info>
    <info>not just Washington. The U.S. is not the only country to pass Global </info>
    <info>Magnitsky legislation. A number of others have as well, including the </info>
    <info>United Kingdom, and there have been some recent extensions of that. And </info>
    <info>there have been quite a lot of discussions in both these countries </info>
    <info>about how they should be used, and there's a lot of coordination, which </info>
    <info>is important.</info>
    <info>    I would say, sadly, the main obstacle is the fact that it's new and </info>
    <info>there's a certain amount of discomfort, I think, in the administration </info>
    <info>of maybe using them too liberally, and within that limited appetite </info>
    <info>there's a lot of people in a lot of countries that are all vying to put </info>
    <info>their names on a Global Magnitsky list. But certainly some names have </info>
    <info>been furnished to the State Department and to the Treasury Department, </info>
    <info>and there have been moves to try to promote within the administration </info>
    <info>to consider them closely, and they're primarily, I would say, police </info>
    <info>chiefs and people who've been directly accused of torture, but not just </info>
    <info>them. I mean, there's wider consideration of people within the various </info>
    <info>apparatus of government that is ongoing and systematically persecuting </info>
    <info>civil society. So, yes.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Are there any other questions from the audience?</info>
    <info>    Here in the front.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Thank you very much for this opportunity. I would like </info>
    <info>us to focus on government, not on opposition, but I'm going to ask this </info>
    <info>question because I'm curious. Emin Milli said that the majority of </info>
    <info>Azerbaijani people are silenced, and he's right. This is the case. But </info>
    <info>when asking the question about opposition parties and movements near </info>
    <info>the outset, you mentioned Republican Alternative but you didn't mention </info>
    <info>others, especially Popular Front of Azerbaijan.</info>
    <info>    Now, to be clear, I'm not being supportive of Popular Front of </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. But today this is the single political party who organizes </info>
    <info>demonstrations every month, and at least several thousand people come </info>
    <info>to those demonstrations, knowing that they are going to be subject to </info>
    <info>face recognition [technology]. Now, liking posts is good. Watching </info>
    <info>videos is also good. But to come to demonstrations in person, it needs </info>
    <info>more courage, right?</info>
    <info>    So, going back to the issue you've discussed, I think that if we </info>
    <info>are going to support the Azerbaijani people, we shouldn't try to </info>
    <info>silence political parties, people who are more active, who struggle in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. Because when you mention Republican Alternative but don't </info>
    <info>even mention Popular Front of Azerbaijan--which does, I believe, more </info>
    <info>now than others--that sounds to me like silencing the real struggle of </info>
    <info>the Azerbaijani people.</info>
    <info>    Thank you.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Altstadt. I suspect you and I both remember a time when the </info>
    <info>Popular Front was secretly meeting in the offices of the Academy of </info>
    <info>Science and the university, and they were the pioneers in the anti-</info>
    <info>Soviet movement back in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. And if you </info>
    <info>go back and look at some of the programs which they first articulated, </info>
    <info>what is striking and was always striking to me about the things that </info>
    <info>they wrote was that they really understood what democracy was about. </info>
    <info>They really understood the concepts.</info>
    <info>    And I think part of the reason was that these were largely </info>
    <info>historians and other intellectuals who had studied the First Republic </info>
    <info>and its leadership and its ideals. And they really had a good </info>
    <info>understanding of what this meant. They understand it wasn't simple. </info>
    <info>They understood that democracy is a struggle. Maybe we should treat it </info>
    <info>as a verb rather than as a noun. And I have great respect for that and </info>
    <info>for their tradition, and also the other parties that grew out of it and </info>
    <info>the National Council, which now includes many of those more traditional </info>
    <info>parties.</info>
    <info>    My point is that right at the moment, those parties have been </info>
    <info>effectively marginalized, that they've been pushed out of their </info>
    <info>offices. Their publications and their leadership have been constrained. </info>
    <info>Ali Karimli hasn't been allowed to leave Azerbaijan in over a decade. </info>
    <info>And all of these things, I think, have made it much more difficult for </info>
    <info>them to move ahead with agenda items that they now have. The----</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Sorry, could you say who Ali Karimli is.</info>
    <info>    Dr. Altstadt. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Ali Karimli has been the head of </info>
    <info>the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party since the loss of Elchibey </info>
    <info>Rachmadli. And so these are an important cohort.</info>
    <info>    And I don't want to offend them or you, but they haven't changed </info>
    <info>their methods in a long time. And I don't think they're appealing in </info>
    <info>modern ways to a new group. That's why the younger generation's so </info>
    <info>important. That's why social media's so important, because it's this </info>
    <info>younger generation that needs to take up that baton and move forward.</info>
    <info>    In the early 1990s, people who were my teachers in Azerbaijan in </info>
    <info>the 1980s stuck their necks out. They stepped outside of their comfort </info>
    <info>zones. They got into doing political activism that was exceedingly </info>
    <info>dangerous for people who remembered Stalinism and remembered the </info>
    <info>midnight knock at the door.</info>
    <info>    Within a year, the next generation, people who then were in their </info>
    <info>30s, guys who were considered to be the young radicals like Isa Gambar, </info>
    <info>who was the founder of the Muavat Party, and Etibar Mammadov, the </info>
    <info>Independence Party. These guys looked at the generation who were then </info>
    <info>in their 50s, who have now mostly passed away, and thought that they </info>
    <info>were much too conservative. They just weren't radical enough. They </info>
    <info>needed to go on and be more critical and do more of these kinds of </info>
    <info>things. And those people are now in their 50s and 60s and the next </info>
    <info>generation is coming along and saying you need to be more radical, you </info>
    <info>need to use different methods, and so on.</info>
    <info>    And so no disrespect to anybody intended--and these people were all </info>
    <info>my friends--so I don't want to offend them for personal and other </info>
    <info>reasons--but when I'm asked about the activism for the future of </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan opposition--and agreeing that an opposition that we </info>
    <info>understand in a Western country doesn't truly exist in Azerbaijan--I </info>
    <info>think of that next generation that's pushing the boundaries and pushing </info>
    <info>the frontiers. And so I'm not silencing them. I'm trying to report what </info>
    <info>I think I see, and it's up to them domestically to find their own </info>
    <info>voices.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Milli. Thank you very much for the question. I have personally </info>
    <info>huge respect for everything that Isa Gambar did, for all the struggle </info>
    <info>that Ali Karimli has shown in the last years. They have inspired and </info>
    <info>led ten thousands of people into struggle all these years under the </info>
    <info>worst conditions that anyone can imagine. But I think in the new </info>
    <info>generation of activists and the new generation of people who want to </info>
    <info>change Azerbaijan, they have quite different ideas about the tactics, </info>
    <info>strategy, methods of how this change can be achieved and what this </info>
    <info>change should look like.</info>
    <info>    Again, with all my due respect for all these leaders of opposition </info>
    <info>of Azerbaijan which have been in charge for the last two decades in </info>
    <info>leading this fight, I think it's very important--the best thing that </info>
    <info>these leaders can do now is actually support all of the young people in </info>
    <info>groups, within their parties and outside of their parties, and give a </info>
    <info>message to people of Azerbaijan that their struggle is not personal--</info>
    <info>it's not personally about Isa Gambar, it's not personally about Ali </info>
    <info>Karimli--because, unfortunately, if you talk about problems, we </info>
    <info>shouldn't just target the government--we should talk also about the </info>
    <info>opposition. There is also cult of personality in certain political </info>
    <info>parties.</info>
    <info>    And this is not something that the new generation accepts. Everyone </info>
    <info>should be the leader. This should be the message of any political </info>
    <info>activist, any political leader emerging in Azerbaijan. Anyone who comes </info>
    <info>and says, look, I'm so great, I'm fantastic, and I will lead you into </info>
    <info>the new life--like, this is not something that people of Azerbaijan are </info>
    <info>buying. And you can see it by the views and numbers of people that </info>
    <info>people are reaching.</info>
    <info>    And if people don't come to these protests in Azerbaijan that are </info>
    <info>monthly, routinely organized, maybe people doubt the tactics. Maybe </info>
    <info>they think that this is not effective. Maybe they don't see the point </info>
    <info>to come show up so government spies film them and then pressure them </info>
    <info>and their families. I think millions of people in Azerbaijan are ready </info>
    <info>to stand up and come and fight for freedom, but they are trying to </info>
    <info>understand how we can do it in one day, all of us together--one day to </info>
    <info>come on the street, finish this, and then go home and do our routine </info>
    <info>life.</info>
    <info>    And this leader should be ready that people are questioning it and </info>
    <info>they need to think about how they work with social media, how they </info>
    <info>communicate with people, what their attitudes are toward tactics, </info>
    <info>strategy and communication with the people. So when there are new </info>
    <info>political activists, political leaders or groups emerge and suggest </info>
    <info>something alternative, I think it's a process of national selection.</info>
    <info>    And you cannot say to someone, why do you do this or why you don't </info>
    <info>do this--it's a natural process. And time and history will show what </info>
    <info>can lead and who can change Azerbaijan and what this change will look </info>
    <info>like. But there are certainly, again, hundreds of people who are maybe </info>
    <info>not even on the surface now, but they are ready to lead the government, </info>
    <info>various ministers. They are experts. They are very successful abroad, </info>
    <info>all inside of the country in their own specific field, and they are </info>
    <info>just waiting for this moment that Azerbaijan will change, and then we </info>
    <info>will all see that we are hundreds, thousands of people who can make </info>
    <info>ministries, bureaucracy, political parties and new civic groups.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. I think we have time for one more question. I'm going to </info>
    <info>take the woman in the back, please.</info>
    <info>    Questioner. Hi, I'm Cathy Cosman. I used to work at the U.S. </info>
    <info>Commission on International Religious Freedom.</info>
    <info>    Thank you so much, Maran, for bringing up the issue of religious </info>
    <info>prisoners, the majority, as they are, in all post-Soviet states. And I </info>
    <info>want to point out that the vast majority of political prisoners, or </info>
    <info>religious prisoners--however you want to call them--prisoners of </info>
    <info>conscience, who by definition have not used violence or advocated for </info>
    <info>it, are independent Muslims. And both human rights groups, civil </info>
    <info>society, government groups, with the exception of the organization </info>
    <info>where I used to work, do not pay attention to Muslims. And I really </info>
    <info>think this is not only a flaw from the point of view of human rights, </info>
    <info>but it's also a huge strategic error, because then by ignoring the </info>
    <info>problems of Muslims, be they still living under onerous and unfair </info>
    <info>legislation, or all the more so if they're imprisoned for their </info>
    <info>independent religious views and activities, as Muslims, they of course </info>
    <info>will be alienated from the West. And I think that's something that none </info>
    <info>of us want, I hope.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. Thank you.</info>
    <info>    I would also just comment that Congressman Smith's H. Res. 537 </info>
    <info>calls for the U.S. administration to pursue potential International </info>
    <info>Religious Freedom sanctions, which are travel bans against the worst </info>
    <info>violators of that fundamental freedom within Azerbaijan. So there's </info>
    <info>definitely an intention to that on the part of Congressman Smith's </info>
    <info>resolution.</info>
    <info>    Emin, if you'd like to say a last word, and then I think we'll wrap </info>
    <info>up.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Milli. We have very courageous religious activists like Taleh </info>
    <info>Bagirzade, for example, who's languishing in jail in Azerbaijan. And I </info>
    <info>want you to know that he has quite tolerant and quite embracive views </info>
    <info>about the relationship between government and society.</info>
    <info>    And I think that Islam and religion in Azerbaijan has been </info>
    <info>historically quite different from many times. I mean, it's not for </info>
    <info>nothing that Azerbaijan was the first democratic country in the Muslim </info>
    <info>world, that created parliamentary republic, that gave rights to women </info>
    <info>to vote. And this is another propaganda of government, when they try to </info>
    <info>present situation in Azerbaijan as such, if Aliyev goes, there is this </info>
    <info>bunch of Muslim leaders and activists and Azerbaijan will turn into </info>
    <info>another Iran or Saudi Arabia. This is just not true. Anyone who </info>
    <info>traveled in Azerbaijan, anyone who lived in Azerbaijan, people when </info>
    <info>they come here, they're actually a bit surprised that the level of </info>
    <info>secularism in Azerbaijan, it goes beyond what this government thinks </info>
    <info>about this or can do about it, you know? It is just in the DNA of the </info>
    <info>history of Azerbaijan--and let's say tomorrow Aliyev is gone and we </info>
    <info>have a parliamentary republic, I'm sure there will be Islamist party </info>
    <info>and they will have probably 10-20 percent in parliament.</info>
    <info>    People understand very well the importance of the separation of </info>
    <info>state and religion. And I think a lot of people in Azerbaijan </info>
    <info>understand themselves as Muslims, and this is their constitutional </info>
    <info>right. But when it comes to practice, the majority of Azerbaijanis are </info>
    <info>not practicing Islam in the way, for example, that people in Saudi </info>
    <info>Arabia or Iran are practicing Islam. I'm absolutely sure that, as Maran </info>
    <info>also said, people who are practicing Islam in a way that it is </info>
    <info>practiced, for example, in Iran or other Muslim countries, they have </info>
    <info>major grievances. It's about injustice. It's about how government </info>
    <info>treats its own citizens regardless of them being Muslims or not </info>
    <info>Muslims.</info>
    <info>    And as long as this problem exists, this helps the radicalization </info>
    <info>of this minority, and it doesn't help the development of Azerbaijan. </info>
    <info>The situation is not as the government tries to present it, especially </info>
    <info>here in the West, in the U.S., in Europe. And just one trip to </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan would be enough to understand what kind of society is </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan. So this government, it stops Muslims, everyone in </info>
    <info>Azerbaijan from the next stage of development, unfortunately.</info>
    <info>    Mr. Price. I'm extremely grateful to our panelists, all of whom </info>
    <info>traveled fair distances to be here with us today. I'm especially </info>
    <info>grateful to Emin Milli. I think one of the great opportunities that we </info>
    <info>have with these briefings is to feature people who have been on the </info>
    <info>ground doing the difficult work of defending freedom and spreading free </info>
    <info>information, and at a very high personal cost oftentimes. So I'm </info>
    <info>grateful for your presence and the presence of the other Azeri </info>
    <info>activists who have spoken here today.</info>
    <info>    And I thank you all for your attendance here and for all those who </info>
    <info>have watched live on Facebook Live. The briefing is hereby adjourned.</info>
