    <Doc-title>AN OVERVIEW OF SBA'S 7(A) LOAN PROGRAM</Doc-title>
    <overview>Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight, and</overview>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="">    Present: Representatives Kelly, Chabot, Blum, Bacon, 
Marshall, Adams, and Velazquez.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Good morning. Thank you all for being with
us today. I call this hearing to order.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Our startups, our entrepreneurs, our small businesses, the 
true engines of our economy, continue to experience a rigid 
lending environment. While large companies are turning to debt 
and equity markets to raise capital, small businesses all over 
the country regularly turn to conventional bank lending to 
finance their projects. At times, small firms cannot access 
conventional lending, so they have nowhere to turn for the 
capital to grow their business or create jobs. Despite being 
creditworthy, they often do not have the proven track record 
for traditional lending. Instead of turning away the next great 
American company, lenders can work with small businesses and 
provide access to SBA's numerous lending programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Chairman KELLY">We are here to talk about one of these lending programs 
today. The Advantage Loan Program, widely known as the 7(a) 
Loan Program, provides creditworthy small businesses the 
opportunity to receive capital if traditional lending is not 
available. The program, which is currently running at zero cost 
to the American taxpayer, does not provide direct loans; 
rather, the SBA offers guarantees of repayments made to 
lenders. With the recent growth of the program in terms of loan 
approvals, loan amounts, and the congressionally authorized 
lending limit, it is important for our Committee to 
comprehensively review the program. Does SBA have the correct 
tools in place to provide oversight? Where should there be 
improvement? Is the Credit Elsewhere Test, the test which 
determines whether or not a small business is able to obtain 
capital from traditional options, strong enough?</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Chairman KELLY">The hearing today will kick off a series of conversations 
focused on the 7(a) Loan Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Today, the Subcommittee will hear directly from the 
lender's window, those financial institutions participating in 
the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I appreciate each of the witnesses for being here today. I 
look forward to your testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    I now yield to Ranking Member Adams for opening remarks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I want to thank
Ranking Member Velazquez for being here as well. And to all of 
our witnesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">With the economy showing continued growth, it is important 
to ensure that small businesses have the tools and the 
resources that they need to prosper. And in order for small 
firms to play their traditional job-creating role, a number of 
factors must be in place. Perhaps the most important ingredient 
is the availability of capital. Lending through the Small 
Business Administration is always critical for entrepreneurs 
seeking affordable capital to start new ventures and expand 
existing businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">SBA loan programs fill a critical gap in the market for 
small businesses that cannot access traditional lending 
sources. In particular, SBA's 7(a) Loan Program is a public-
private partnership that helps private lenders provide capital 
to small businesses that would not normally qualify for credit 
on reasonable terms. In recent years, 7(a) loans have 
experienced unprecedented growth, making this hearing 
particularly timely today. While over 64,000 loans totaling $24 
billion was supported in fiscal year 2016, only 26 percent of 
7(a) loans went to minorities, and only 18 percent to women-
owned firms. This is simply unacceptable.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">In addition to these underwhelming numbers, the SBG OIG has 
identified lender oversight as a serious management challenge 
for SBA. The OIG first raised their concerns in fiscal year 
2001, and the issue continues to this very day. As the 7(a) 
Loan Program grows, it is vital for the SBA to have the 
resources in place to conduct lender oversight and to guarantee 
that all entrepreneurs, no matter what gender or race, have 
equal opportunities to utilize the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and gaining 
their insights on making the SBA's flagship program work even 
better for small businesses. It is vital that loans in the 7(a) 
programs are targeted to businesses who need them most, 
particularly those who have been unable to secure capital 
through private channels. Putting capital in the hands of 
businesses that need it most will help further the economic 
development of America's small businesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">So on that note, again, I would like to thank our witnesses 
for taking time to be here. Your views and experiences, of 
course, will be valuable to the Subcommittee as we consider how 
best to meet the entrepreneurs' capital needs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">    Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Thanks to the ranking member. And this is
such a bipartisan Committee, and I really thank the ranking 
member for her support and being here today and her timely 
comments.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Chairman KELLY">If the Committee members have an opening statement 
prepared, I ask that they be submitted for the record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I would like to take a moment to explain the timing lights 
to you. You will each have 5 minutes to deliver your testimony. 
The light starts out as green. It will turn yellow, and 
finally, after, when you have 1 minute remaining, that means 
start wrapping up, and finally, at the end of your 5 minutes, 
it will turn red. I ask that you try to adhere to the time 
limit and in my first Committee chairman not make me tap you 
out today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Our first witness--I am going to introduce the three and 
then I will allow the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Our first witness is Sonya McDonald. Ms. McDonald is an 
executive vice president and chief lending officer for Randolph 
Brooks Federal Credit Union in Universal City, Texas, which is 
located in southcentral Texas. She has been serving credit 
union members in various roles at Randolph Brooks Federal 
Credit Union for years, including numerous executive level and 
leadership positions. Along with being a recipient of the 
Presidential Volunteer Service Award, Ms. McDonald was named to 
the San Antonio's 40 Under 40 List and is a graduate of the 
University of Texas at Austin. She is testifying today on 
behalf of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit 
Unions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Our next witness is Ms. Cindy Blankenship. Ms. Blankenship 
is the vice chairman of Bank of the West in Grapevine, Texas. 
Having opened Bank of the West in 1986 with her husband, Ms. 
Blankenship has been a leader in community banking for many 
years. Ms. Blankenship is a former chair of the Independent 
Community Bankers of America and has testified before numerous 
congressional committees. She has been recognized in the past 
as one of the 50 most powerful women in banking. Ms. 
Blankenship is testifying today on behalf of the Independent 
Community Bankers of America.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Our next witness is Tony Wilkinson. Mr. Wilkinson is the 
president and chief executive officer of the National 
Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders. For over 25 
years, Mr. Wilkinson has been at the helm of the Association 
which represents the 7(a) lending industry. Before coming to 
NAGGL, Mr. Wilkinson was an executive at Stillwater National 
Bank. He has served as a member of the SBA's National Advisory 
Council and as a member of SBA's Investment Advisory Council. 
He has also been a recipient of SBA's National Financial 
Services Advocate of the Year Award.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    And I now yield to our ranking member.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">Thank you, Mr. Chair.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">    I am so pleased to introduce Ted Ashby, a native of Mount 
Airy, North Carolina. I represent North Carolina, and we are 
happy to have a Tarheel in the place today. Mr. Ashby has a 
bachelor's degree in business administration and economics. He

panel.</paragraph>

may begin.

    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="SONYA MCDONALD">                 AND CEO, SURREY BANK AND TRUST
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">Chairman Kelly, Ranking Member Adams, and
members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the invitation to 
appear before you this morning.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">My name is Sonya McDonald, and I am testifying today on 
behalf of NAFCU. I am the executive vice president and chief 
lending officer at Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union. In 
this role, I am responsible for a $6 billion portfolio that 
encompasses consumer, mortgage, and commercial lending. I 
appreciate the opportunity to share with you my experience with 
the Small Business Administration's 7(a) Loan Program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">RBFCU became a SBA preferred and express lender in 
September of 2005. We are delegated with SBA authority and are 
able to offer all of their products. In 2016, we were the 
number one SBA lending credit union in our 55 county district. 
SBA products allow us to leverage our lending dollars, mitigate 
the risk associated with the loans, and extend more credit to 
our community small businesses. Our current portfolio has 232 
active SBA loans with a balance of approximately $22 million.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">There are many stories of small business owners looking for 
that loan that will allow them to either start or grow their 
business. While other institutions may have scaled back their 
small-dollar business lending, credit unions have been willing 
to fill that void. At RBFCU, we are pleased that we have been 
able to step up to help meet the demand. SBA 7(a) loans make it 
easier for credit unions because the government-guaranteed 
portion of these loans does not count towards the arbitrary 
credit union member business lending cap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">In San Antonio, we have a great bagel shop, the Bagel 
Factory, owned by an Air Force veteran and his wife. They went 
to 20 different places and were denied before coming to 
Randolph Brooks for an SBA loan. That business is now in its 
seventh year and thriving.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">Another example is a loan we did for a 100 percent disabled 
military veteran. With the help of a SBA express line of 
credit, he was able to secure 8(a) certification, and he can 
now fulfill software development contracts for the military.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">Two years ago, NAFCU signed a memo of understanding with 
SBA to help address the challenge of getting more credit unions 
involved in the SBA. The MOU formalized a joint partnership 
that aims to increase the availability of small-dollar loans by 
providing more outlets for entrepreneurs to access SBA products 
in their neighborhoods, and it makes the small-dollar loans 
more accessible to underserved communities, including women and 
minorities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">We appreciate the work SBA has done and have some ideas on 
how to make the program stronger. One area where the SBA can 
help credit unions is to provide clarity. Sometimes when we 
email the SBA directly with a specific question about standard 
operating procedures, the response is nothing more than a 
screenshot of the website. We have also seen an example of a 
loan submitted through general processing where the SBA 
processor did not follow the SOP. It was a loan that required 
us to place a second lien on a borrower's rental property. 
Normally, we would use the tax assessed value on the home, but 
in this case, the processor insisted we use the value estimated 
by Zillow.com, which was not anywhere in the procedure manual.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">If SBA would publish a best practices and clarify guidance, 
it would go a long way to helping credit unions when they are 
making SBA loans.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">At RBFCU, we would also like to see the length of time it 
takes to approve a loan shortened. Right now it can take 8 
weeks or longer.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">For RBFCU and other credit unions, it would also be 
beneficial if the new SBA One software better integrated with 
the lending software used by the majority of lenders, something 
the old software used to do.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">In conclusion, small businesses are the driving force of 
our economy and the key to its success. The ability for them to 
have access to capital is vital for job creation. While SBA's 
7(a) program provides opportunities to established and 
struggling businesses, there are several relatively simple 
steps that could propel the program to its full potential, some 
of which the SBA can take without legislation. We urge Congress 
to do what is necessary to ensure these programs are 
successful.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD">    We thank you for your time and the opportunity to testify 
before you today on this important issue. I welcome any 
comments or questions you might have.

    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF CINDY BLANKENSHIP</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="CINDY BLANKENSHIP"> Ms. Blankenship, you are now recognized for
5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">Chairman Kelly, Ranking Member Adams, and
members of the Subcommittee, I am Cynthia Blankenship, vice 
chairman, CFO, and corporate president of Bank of the West in 
Grapevine, Texas, an over $450 million community with 105 
employees and serving the Dallas-Fort Worth suburban area. I am 
also a former chairman of the Independent Community Bankers of 
America, and I am pleased to testify today on behalf of more 
than 5,800 community banks represented by ICBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">A robust 7(a) program with broad community bank 
participation will help small business thrive and create jobs. 
We are grateful for this Committee's strong support of the 7(a) 
program. Bank of the West is a 30-year partner with the Small 
Business Administration and a leading SBA lender in the Fort 
Worth District. We currently hold and service nearly $100 
million in high-quality SBA loans with a minimum loss ratio. 
Historically, Bank of the West 7(a) loans have created 
thousands of jobs in the communities we serve and help sustain 
and strengthen our local economy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">Bank of the West uses the 7(a) Loan Program to supplement 
our lending and credit services by reaching a broader range of 
borrowers who would not qualify for a conventional loan. To 
safeguard the program from abuse, the SBA's Credit Elsewhere 
Test requires us to fully substantiate and document the reasons 
a given applicant cannot be served with conventional credit. 
The typical conventional small business loan has a maturity of 
1 to 3 years because it is funded with short-term deposits. 
However, 7(a) program loans have average maturities of 16 years 
or more. The program even allows for loan terms up to 25 years. 
These longer terms lower the entrepreneur's loan payments and 
free up needed cash flow to hire, invest, and grow the 
business. When another recession occurs, the longer loan term 
may help many small businesses weather the crisis.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">Bank of the West has been a preferred SBA lender for 30 
years. This program is available to lenders with a proven track 
record, a successful SBA lending whose lending policies and 
procedures have been thoroughly vetted by the SBA. Once 
approved, a preferred lender can use streamlined procedures for 
processing SBA loans and make final credit decisions in-house. 
This is a critical advantage because it allows us to avoid a 
delay of up to 3 weeks at the SBA approval offices.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">As an SBA preferred lender, we can be responsive to our 
credit applicants, and if they qualify, provide the funds in a 
timely fashion.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">Stable funding is critical to the success of the 7(a) 
program and the thousands of borrowers who rely on it. While 
the program is fully funded by user fees, an authorization 
level must be approved by Congress each year, and once that 
level is reached, no more loans can be approved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">The program authority came to an abrupt halt in the summer 
of 2015 when it reached its authorization cap well before the 
end of the fiscal year. Congress was forced to pass an 
emergency increase to the authorization cap to restart the 
program. ICBA greatly appreciates the support and 
responsiveness of this Committee in passing that emergency 
increase. Thankfully, a hiatus was short lived. A longer 
program shutdown would have cut off the thousands of small 
businesses that rely on the program for payroll, investment, 
and expansion. We must work together to ensure that the program 
funding is never disrupted again. One way we might better 
achieve this funding stability is by creating a 2-year funding 
commitment and have it be renewed every year.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">I have focused my remarks today on the 7(a) program. 
However, taking a broader perspective, I urge this Committee to 
support regulatory and tax relief that would strengthen 
community banks and enable more small business lending in SBA 
programs and in conventional markets.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">ICBA's plan for prosperity is a robust set of legislative 
recommendations, many of which serve the same goal as the SBA, 
creating more small business credit that will in turn create 
economic growth and jobs. A copy of the plan is attached to my 
statement, and I would encourage you to read it and discuss it 
with the community bankers in your districts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">    Thank you again for convening this hearing. I am happy to 
answer any questions you may have.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Thank you, Ms. Blankenship. It is always
nice to hear somebody who does not have an accent.</paragraph>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF TONY WILKINSON</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="TONY WILKINSON">    Mr. Wilkinson, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member
Adams, and other members of the Committee. I am Tony Wilkinson. 
I am the president and CEO of the National Association of 
Government Guaranteed Lenders. I am happy to be here today to 
talk about the very successful SBA 7(a) program. It is a 
public-private partnership that works as there are almost 2,000 
financial institutions who participate in the program, reaching 
about 65,000 small businesses annually. These lenders make 
private sector loans to small businesses who are credit worthy 
but fall into the well-known lending gap that small businesses 
face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">Through the 7(a) program, lenders are able to meet the 
long-term financing needs of their small business customers. 
That means we can appropriately finance a long-term asset with 
a long-term loan. The significant majority of conventional 
loans, as Ms. Blankenship mentioned, have original maturities 
of 3 years or less, and the bulk of those loans actually have 
maturities of 1 year or less. So banks are really good at doing 
short-term financing, but with the SBA product we are able to 
do long-term financing. Again, financing those long-term assets 
with a long-term loan.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">And as Ms. Blankenship said, our original maturities in an 
SBA 7(a) program are 16 years. And so those longer maturities 
mean lower payments for those small business borrowers. And 
when small business can get the financing that they need, they 
can expand and grow and create jobs. It has been estimated that 
well over 500,000 jobs are created or retained annually thanks 
to the 7(a) program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">Over the last several years, use of the program has grown 
dramatically. Loan volume in fiscal year 2016 was over 25 
percent greater than it was just in fiscal year 2014, meaning 
more and more small businesses are being served. But it also 
means we have been operating at or near our congressionally 
authorized annual authorization cap. This fiscal year, under 
the current continuing resolution, the 7(a) program has a $26.5 
billion authorization cap. Based on current loan volumes and 
projected growth, we anticipate lending about $26 billion net 
this year. So again, we are going to be getting very close to 
our annual cap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">I want to make sure that we understand that that is a net 
number. Our gross lending will probably exceed the cap 
somewhat. And as loans for whatever reason do not get closed, 
they get canceled, and so we get down to a net number, but it 
is very likely that our gross lending will exceed our cap, but 
it is the net lending number that is important.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">As funding measures are considered with the April 28th 
expiration of the continuing resolution, a modest bump up in 
our authorization cap would be appreciated just to make sure 
that we have sufficient funds to get through this year as 
predicting future loan volumes, as you might imagine, is a very 
difficult task. Please keep in mind that the 7(a) program 
operates at a zero credit subsidy, meaning no appropriations 
are needed. The estimated costs of the program are paid for by 
the fees charged to lenders and borrowers. So let me repeat. No 
Federal appropriations are needed to fund credit subsidies for 
this program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">It is a long-held belief in our association for this 
program to pass the test of time to be here for small 
businesses for many years to come, it has to be a program of 
integrity. The program must be used the right way. That is what 
we teach in our training programs. It is what we expect from 
our members. It is why we understand that it is in the 
program's best interest to have SBA engaged in a sustained, 
efficient, and cost-effective oversight program to maintain 
that integrity. NAGGL has worked, and will continue to work, 
with the SBA and this Committee and SBA's Office of Credit Risk 
Management to ensure that integrity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">    With that, I will close my remarks and be happy to answer 
any questions.

    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <opening>STATEMENT OF EDWARD C. ASHBY III</opening>
    <paragraph paraId="1" speaker="EDWARD C. ASHBY III"> Thank you. And Mr. Ashby, you are now
recognized for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="2" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">Chairman Kelly, Ranking Member Adams, and
members of the Subcommittee, I am Ted Ashby, president and CEO 
of Surrey Bank and Trust, headquartered in Mount Airy, North 
Carolina. I appreciate the opportunity to present the views of 
the ABA on the importance of the SBA Advantage Loan Program, 
widely known as the SBA 7(a) program for community banks like 
mine.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="3" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">Our bank was chartered in 1996 with a focus on business 
lending. We are intentionally focused on building and 
maintaining long-term relationships with our customers. The 
success of Surrey Bank is linked to the success of our 
community. They are all our neighbors.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="4" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">Community banks like mine actively pursue small business 
loans, which is critical to the economic growth and job 
creation in our area. The SBA program supports this with the 
help to fill a critical gap particularly for early stage 
businesses that need access to longer term loans. The guarantee 
helps reduce the risk and capital required for banks and 
facilitates loans that may never have been made without this 
important level of support from the SBA.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="5" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">In 1999, Surrey Bank began using SBA to help local 
companies meet their credit needs. This is an integral part of 
our business model. We have 174 active loans with an average 
loan size of $200,000, which demonstrates that the 7(a) program 
is very important to us and to our community. In total, 19 
percent of our business loans are insured by the SBA, and 13 
percent of all our loans are insured by the SBA. Our active 
involvement in SBA has earned Surrey Bank the ``Community Bank 
of the Year'' award in North Carolina 12 of the past 14 years.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="6" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">Let me give you a couple of examples to show the importance 
of SBA to our community. We extended credit to a precast 
concrete company that opened its doors in 2007, a terrible time 
to open. With the recession, economic activity was weak and the 
borrower had difficulty generating enough working capital to 
fund new orders. Our bank used the SBA's Cap Lines Contract 
Loan Program to fund these individual orders until they could 
be completed and the business paid. This company now generates 
sufficient cash flow to fund its operations without the SBA or 
bank assistance.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="7" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">My second example, we extended credit to a woman-owned 
company that is engaged in traffic and safety control and 
highway and bridge construction. This company started in 2004 
with four employees and just two trucks. Since inception, we 
granted 23 SBA loans to this company to help fund their 
expansion. Today, the company has over $12 million in revenue, 
90 employees, and a fleet of over 100 vehicles and assorted 
other equipment. Quite a success story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="8" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">But our success is replicated over and over across 
communities in America in the banking system. This is why the 
ABA supports the Small Business Committee's efforts to build on 
the positive aspects of the program and consider improvements 
that would benefit the business climate in our communities.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="9" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">I have noted in my written statement many positive features 
of the 7(a) program. The central focus of these features is 
that they reduce the cost of the transaction, lower general 
collateral requirements, provide faster response times, improve 
cash flow, and reduce the amount of working capital needed to 
operate the business. All of these facilitate loans that may 
have never been possible under conventional financing where 
under conventional financing you would require an abundance of 
collateral. You have a guarantor that has a strong secondary 
source of repayment, and you would most likely have shorter 
loan amortizations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="10" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">However, improvements can be made to any program. 
Primarily, this is involved in the servicing aspects. These 
include consolidating loans, allowing portfolio lenders to 
obtain a guarantee to avoid regulations on loans to one 
borrower limitations, facilitating and offering compromise in 
cases where they may be in liquidation through multiple 
programs, and making the SBA One platform fully operational to 
reduce our paperwork.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="11" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">In conclusion, the SBA's 7(a) program is a success and 
should be supported in the future. It has encouraged economic 
growth and allowed Surrey Bank to meet the credit needs of many 
small and diverse businesses in our small portion of the state 
of North Carolina.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="12" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">ABA strongly believes that our communities cannot reach 
their full potential without the presence of a local bank. Last 
year 251 banks disappeared. Since Dodd-Frank was enacted, 
nearly 2,000 banks have merged or closed their doors. If the 
pressures on our small banks are not relieved, the loss will be 
felt far beyond the bank and its loss of employees for that 
bank. It will mean something significant has been lost in that 
community that was once served by the bank. That is why it is 
imperative that Congress take steps to enhance the banking 
industry's capacity to serve their customers and facilitate job 
creation and economic growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="13" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">    Thank you. I will be happy to answer any questions.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="14" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I want to once again just thank the
distinguished members of the panel. Thank you so much for what 
you bring.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="15" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I think one of the main things that is important to me, and 
I recognize myself for 5 minutes, so I will hold myself to the 
same thing, but one of the most important things is this 7(a) 
Loan Program costs us, or costs the taxpayers nothing. So I 
think that is very important. So it is a great program because 
there is no cost associated with while creating small 
businesses or helping them to create small businesses it does 
not cost.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="16" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    And this first question is for the entire panel, but I will 
start with--I will let Ms. Blankenship answer first and then we 
can go along the list. From the lender's perspective, can you 
describe the Credit Elsewhere Test and the steps you take to 
verify whether a small business can obtain capital from another 
source?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="17" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> We look at the Credit Elsewhere Test and
go through the parameters that SBA has lined out. And 
basically, that is how we qualify that small business as an 
alternative source of funding through the SBA. Many times those 
small businesses are not a good candidate for conventional 
financing because they do not have the collateral value or they 
are depending on future cash flows, projected cash flows. We 
personally do a lot of startups, as well as acquisitions for 
small businesses, as well as some franchise. And a lot of times 
there is not a historical record there. And personally, I was 
able to give my hair stylist Kim a loan to acquire a salon when 
the owner died. She was a young lady. She had good credit, but 
did not have a lot of collateral. So we were able to help her 
acquire that salon. She hired eight additional stylists, paid 
her SBA loan off early, and that is just one story where the 
Credit Elsewhere Test is a good tool, and we do use it so we 
can slot that customer in the right type of either conventional 
or SBA loans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="18" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> Yeah, and I guess for the public, the few
people who are watching this hearing, is the credit elsewhere 
means you are not competing with other sources. If they can get 
credit in another place, then they have to do that. They cannot 
use this program. They have to only use this if it is the only 
resource that they can use to get there. Is that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="19" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> That is correct.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="20" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> Okay. Do one of you other three, does
anybody want to take a stab before I ask the next question?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="21" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> From my perspective, we are no different than
our friends in the banking industry. We look at the loan and we 
see, first of all, can we do it in a conventional manner? And 
if we cannot--and it is usually because they do not have the 
down payment, they need a longer term, et cetera--but from a 
credit union's perspective, we follow the same rules as our 
friends in the banking industry.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="22" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> And Mr. Ashby, I think you had a comment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="23" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> We do not specifically look at the Credit
Elsewhere Test. When we underwrite a loan, we are looking at 
the collateral coverage cash flow and secondary source of 
repayment. And a lot of the conventional financing is 
homogenized because regulators like to know what our loan 
policies are. And all our loan policies are generally the same 
as you go from bank to bank. So you can identify really very 
quickly which loans need this kind of support and help from the 
SBA on extended terms.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="24" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="25" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    Mr. Wilkinson, in your testimony, you described the PARRIS, 
P-A-R-R-I-S, review system as a tool in SBA's oversight tool 
box. What other tools does SBA and the Office of Credit Risk 
Management utilize to conduct lender oversight?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="26" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> Sorry about that. A relatively new system
that they put in place over the last 4 or 5 years, but it is an 
analytically driven program that they used to target what 
reviews are going to happen amongst their lenders. And that is 
where then they can choose what kind of reviews which lenders 
are going to get. And it appears to be working quite well. The 
one issue that we would be concerned about is making sure that 
the Office of Credit Risk Management has sufficient resources 
to do its job. With the growth we have had in the program, we 
need to make sure that their resources have increased 
commensurately so that they have the appropriate staff to 
continue to do the job that they need to do.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="27" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> And I yield back myself the time that I
have not used. And I now recognize our ranking member from 
North Carolina, Ms. Adams, for 5 minutes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="28" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you all for your
testimony.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="29" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">    Mr. Ashby, in your written testimony you mention positive 
aspects of the 7(a) program and other SBA programs, including 
SCORE. Do you have any success stories or specific examples of 
how SCORE counseling has benefitted small business clients? And 
what improvements can be made there?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="30" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> Comments were primarily related to feedback that
we have gotten from customers that have gone through that 
process, and they think it is very valuable to have someone 
that has basically fought the fight and learned how to navigate 
through their business careers and how to help these people 
overcome some of the obstacles that happen in their business 
because we go through cycles, and some of these retired people 
have seen many business cycles. And so my experience is that we 
get great feedback. We are not present during those counseling 
sessions, but we do get feedback that it is most important to 
them to have a mentor.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="31" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. Let me ask you. You know, I had a
listening session last week, some people would refer to it as a 
townhall, up in the upper part of my district in Huntersville, 
and we had a lot of veterans to come in to talk to us. Do you 
deal much with veterans? Have they been interested in the 
program through your bank?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="32" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> We have had--I think we probably made three or
four loans to veterans last year. There is a special carve-out 
for veterans on fees for loans amount of a certain dollar 
amount. So we do have interest from veterans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="33" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. You also note that the SBA One program
platform is not fully operational. What enhancements should be 
made to the system?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="34" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> Well, right now, basically, we can only get the
issuance of the guarantee, and I think it was originally 
designed that you can go soup to nuts. You can do the initial 
qualification and then you can print all the closing documents 
all on one platform. And so I guess the second half of that 
platform is not fully complete at this time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="35" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. To what extent, I mean, as a follow-up,
has the SBA sought feedback from lenders to improve the system?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="36" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> We get constant feedback from our district
director, Lynn Douthett. And so we are being called on all the 
time to talk about what types of loans we are seeing. If we 
need any training, they oftentimes request Surrey Bank train 
some of the new people that are coming into the SBA lending 
arena because we have been at it a long time and we are a small 
bank. And we try to help them get the proper resources in-house 
in order not to run in trouble with the SOP and have problems 
going forward, so----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="37" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="38" speaker="Mr. ASHBY">--we have a good relationship.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="39" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">Great. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="40" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">    Mr. Wilkinson, for a small business to participate in the 
7(a) program it must not be able to obtain conventional 
lending. How does a lender determine if a borrower cannot get 
credit elsewhere?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="41" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> Okay. The Credit Elsewhere Test is that the
borrower cannot find financing under reasonable terms and 
conditions. So a lender will take a look at each small business 
borrower and determine whether it fits into their own 
conventional credit policies. For instance, many of our credit 
policies say we do not lend to new business startups. In the 
SBA program, year-to-date, we are about 36 percent new business 
startups. So that is sort of one of the automatics that fit. As 
has been mentioned, sometimes it is collateral coverage. 
Sometimes it is cash flow coverage. There are some statistical 
numbers that lenders look at, and perhaps if those numbers do 
not reach a benchmark that is sufficient for conventional 
financing, then they would be candidates for the SBA program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="42" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. Given that it is the lender's best
interest to make the determination that the borrower cannot 
obtain credit elsewhere so that they can make the loan, add to 
its assets or make money off of the loan, to what extent does a 
potential conflict of interest exist there?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="43" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> I guess the first thing is banks are in the
business of lending money, and with every loan that they make 
they hope to generate a profit from those. I think what you are 
referring to is the ability to sell loans into a secondary 
market where the banks can recoup the funds that they have lent 
plus generate a profit on those. Those loans that are sold are 
typically sold by lenders who have liquidity issues. Lenders 
who do not have liquidity issues typically hold their loans. 
That is why only about 40 percent of the loans in the 7(a) 
market are sold into the secondary market. Most of the loans, a 
majority of the loans are actually held and not sold.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="44" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. All right. I am out of time. Mr. Chair, I
yield back. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="45" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I thank the ranking member.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="46" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I do want to recognize both our chairman, Chairman Chabot, 
from the great State of Ohio, and our Ranking Member Velazquez 
from New York. And I thank both of them for honoring me by 
being here today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="47" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    And now I recognize the gentleman from Kansas, Dr. 
Marshall.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="48" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">Mr. Chairman, I am so excited to be here. It
is a breath of fresh air to talk about a government-private 
partnership that is working. I am just here to celebrate. I 
needed a breath of fresh air.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="49" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">Thank you so much for the people that have made the effort. 
We need to keep accentuating the positive, and I appreciate 
some of you brought solutions. Ms. Blankenship talked about a 
2-year funding commitment. What a novel idea to give you all 
certainty. I hope that the chairman and our staff take notes of 
these possible solutions. And Ms. McDonald, you talked about 
best practices. Give me the best practices and we will do it. 
What a novel idea. Timeliness. These people that need the 
money, they need to get in the game now because 6 months from 
now may be too late for this business opportunity.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="50" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">You talked about software. Good luck with that. I have been 
fighting that one wherever I go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="51" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">I do not know about you all, but my community woke up 
November the 9th, and it was a breath of fresh air. My 
entrepreneurs have been drowning in regulation, and all of a 
sudden they started popping up, coming out of nowhere.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="52" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">    And Ms. Blankenship, have you seen an increased number of 
entrepreneurs out there since November the 9th? What is going 
on in the business world in Grapevine, Texas?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="53" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> Well, I am proud to say we have seen an
uptick and a demand for entrepreneurs. And really, I think, 
personally what I have seen coming through our loan committee, 
whether it be SBA or conventional lending, is there is just a 
renewed energy out there. During the crisis years, we saw a lot 
of our small businesses really pull back on expansion and 
investment and resources into their business because they did 
not know what the economy was going to do. And I think there is 
a new confidence. We are seeing people that would not have 
taken a gamble on starting a new business or just trying to 
acquire another business. We have seen quite an increase in 
that. And I think that accounts for the increase in the 
program. The program has been critical to us for 30 years. Some 
banks, you know, we see players come in and out of the market 
but we have been in it for 30 years. And I think the reason it 
works for us and some of the other people that stay in it is 
because you have to make a commitment and have your own 
resources in-house and just use the program as it was intended. 
And it is hugely successful.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="54" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">Well, thanks. And we do understand
commitments to your community to do these types of projects.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="55" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">    Ms. McDonald, talk about agribusiness. I am just curious. 
Do you see much SBA loans like this for agribusiness, 
agriculture? Is that a big part of your market or not so much?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="56" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> It is not a big part of our market.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="57" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">That is too bad.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="58" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL">    Mr. Ashby, I am not sure how rural you are. Do you see much 
agri-economics going on with yours?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="59" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> We have seen a lot of activity in the poultry
industry and we have participated, I think, probably maybe, I 
think, two or three loans last year. There is competition in 
that field with FSA.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="60" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="61" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> USDA makes those loans, also. But that was a
large growth industry in North Carolina last year.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="62" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL"> Ms. McDonald, let me come back to you. You
talked about your bagel loan, and that is just a great, great 
story. Walk me through this business model just a little bit. 
And I am sure you are not supposed to give me too many 
specifics. Mr. Ashby talked about a $200,000 average loan, but 
a business like the bagel industry, that is not a $400,000--I 
mean, are these $40,000 and $60,000, $80,000, 90,000 loans? 
Give me just kind of a feel for what your more typical loan 
looks like.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="63" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> At Randolph Brooks, our average SBA loan is
$90,000. So these are not high-dollar loans.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="64" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL"> Yeah. Let's kind of walk through the terms
and differences between this and a more bank-traditional loan. 
I mean, I had some experience going through these. You know, 
first of all, the differences are does the SBA still guarantee 
85 percent of the loan? Or about how much does it do now?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="65" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> It depends on the amount. So if it is less
than $150,000, then it is 85 percent; if it is more than 
$150,000, it is 75.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="66" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL"> Okay. And, you know, typically, you would
walk into a bank. These are kind of high-risk loans. If they 
are a well-qualified person, a bank might be asking 20, 30 
percent down. How much down are these type of loans going to--
how much capital?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="67" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> So at Randolph Brooks, our conventional loans
are 20 percent down. With the SBA guarantee, it can be 10 
percent down. And because we can extend the term, it makes the 
payment much more palatable.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="68" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL"> Exactly. So you addressed the term. What
about interest rates? You know, as best as applies and apples, 
is it about the same as a conventional loan? Is it more? Is it 
less?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="69" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> I mean, it is a little bit more. You are
taking on the risk.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="70" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL"> Meaning a little bit more, like half a point,
50 basis points, or what?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="71" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> I could not answer that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="72" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> The interest rates are statutorily set.
There is a maximum rate of prime plus 2-3/4. The average 
interest rate today is running at prime plus 2.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. MARSHALL</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="73" speaker="Mr. MARSHALL"> Thanks. That solved it. Thank you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="74" speaker="Chairman KELLY">The gentleman's time is expired.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="75" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    I now recognize the ranking member from New York, Ms. 
Velazquez.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="76" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="77" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Ms. Blankenship, thank you for being here today, and it is 
really nice to see you again.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="78" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    I understand that SBA has been slow to fulfill their 
mandate to maximize the effectiveness of SBA LINC and SBA One. 
It is critical that SBA is using the best technological 
solutions to do so. How important is it to community banks and 
other SBA lenders that SBA continues to streamline their 
processes using technology to maximize the usefulness of SBA 
LINC and SBA One?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="79" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> Well, I think especially of our community
bank, timeliness is everything. So any advances and 
streamlining procedures that the SBA can finish up this SBA One 
and the LINC--it is not fully operational right now. We are 
using a third-party software and we are basically running those 
parallel. And we do get continued and regular communication 
from SBA encouraging us to use SBA One. And in talking to our 
lenders on the SBA side, they are very encouraged by the final 
product should it become fully functional. But right now it is 
not fully functional, but it looks like it will greatly 
increase our efficiencies. It will increase our turn times, and 
I think someone mentioned that funding is critical many times, 
especially in a small business startup or acquisition.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="80" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Funding is critical, and in terms of funding
for SBA?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="81" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> Well, the funding for SBA is critical, but
our ability to fund----
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="82" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Sure.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="83" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP">--in a timely manner is very critical as
well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="84" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Yes, I agree.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="85" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    Mr. Wilkinson, we have heard from many lenders about SBA's 
SOPs under lender guidelines. What is your view of those SOPs, 
and can they be improved?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="86" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">Well, just as a point of clarification,
there are regulations that SBA has issued over the years, and 
they are fairly short. And then in addition to those 
regulations they have put out what they call Standard Operation 
Procedure Manuals, and those are not so short. They are pretty 
thick. And those are the ones that we have to pay very, very 
close attention to. Sometimes those SOPs get changed rather 
quickly, and sometimes without notice. We see it from emails 
coming in from some of our members. But for the most part, SBA 
does try to work with us and find ways to streamline the 
program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="87" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">If we go back to just fiscal year 2012, this was a $15 
billion program. I tip my hat to the last couple or three folks 
that have been in charge of the Office of Capital Access at 
SBA. They were all former bankers. They understood our issues 
when we brought them to them, and really worked to try to 
streamline it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="88" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">    So from a $15 billion program in 2012--and we have a 
request out for next year to make it a $30 billion program. So 
while the SOPs can be somewhat onerous and we pull our hair out 
sometimes in trying to figure out what some of the changes are, 
the fact is that things have gotten a lot better and we are 
looking at an industry that has doubled since 2012.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="89" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">Glad to hear that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="90" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ">    Mr. Wilkinson, I know that several members today have 
raised the Credit Elsewhere Test, but I want to ask you about 
whether or not you believe that there are instances where some 
lenders are not adhering to this test.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="91" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">Could there be some lenders who are
originating loans that could be done conventionally? I could 
not say unequivocally the answer is no. I mean, there is most 
likely somebody who has made a loan today where a borrower 
could get a conventional product. But that is where the role of 
lender oversight at SBA comes into play.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="92" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">    As Ms. Blankenship described, every loan file has to 
explain why they cannot make that loan on a conventional basis, 
and they have to cover the things that cause that reason, be it 
lack of collateral or lack of cash flow that meets their 
conventional standards. Perhaps it is because the borrower 
needs the 25-year maturity rather than the much shorter 
maturity that banks like to do on conventional financing. That 
documentation needs to be in the file. And if it is not there 
and that lender goes to ask for the guarantee to be honored, 
chances are the answer is going to be no to the guarantee 
request.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. VELAZQUEZ</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="93" speaker="Ms. VELAZQUEZ"> Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="94" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I thank the gentlelady.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="95" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    I now recognize the great gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. 
Bacon.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="96" speaker="Mr. BACON">Thank you for being here. I appreciate your time
and traveling here. I am grateful to you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="97" speaker="Mr. BACON">Most of my questions were already asked. I just want to 
express my concern with your comments, Mr. Ashby, about the 
banks that are closing, our community banks and the 
consolidations, a lot of it a result of Dodd-Frank. I think 
that is an underreported story, and we here should be concerned 
about it in Congress. I mean, for small communities, it is a 
bad trend and I think we have got to fix that. So I would have 
a commitment to help you out with that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="98" speaker="Mr. BACON">    On that note with Dodd-Frank, when I talk to our folks in 
the Second District of Nebraska, I hear from the banks it is 
very hard to give small loans anymore separate from the SBA 
because of the Dodd-Frank regulations. I think that forces a 
lot of our small businesses to go to the SBA, which is a 
government program and policy causing a problem and then using 
another government solution to help fix it. Is this a correct 
observation? Do I have that right? For anybody who would like 
to answer.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="99" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> Our program has grown dramatically over the
last few years and I do not know that we could singularly say 
that it was because of Dodd-Frank. I think there are a lot of 
things. The economy is improving. There are more entrepreneurs 
looking to borrow today. Our loan volume, our growth is up 
year-to-date about 7 to 8 percent over last year. Are there 
provisions of Dodd-Frank that are pushing lenders to shrink 
their conventional credit box and expand their SBA box? I would 
say the answer is probably yes. To what extent I could not 
quantify that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="100" speaker="Mr. BACON"> Okay.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="101" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> At Surrey Bank, we do not think there is as
large a business opportunity in lending to individuals for 
personal needs as there are in small business lending because 
these regulations are very complex and the risk of running 
afoul of those regulations is significant.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="102" speaker="Mr. BACON"> One more question. I think each of you touch on
it just a little bit, but I would love to have clarity 
together. If you could say or tell us one thing you would like 
us to help improve with the SBA and the 7(a) process what would 
it be?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="103" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> I would like to see us be able to
refinance an existing SBA loan on our books. We probably lose 
three to four loans a year because the rules will not allow us 
to take out another SBA loan, and it becomes particularly 
cumbersome when it has been sold into the secondary market. But 
as a result, we end up losing not only the customer but the 
deposits, so the deposits go out of our community bank. That is 
deposit dollars that could have been leveraged into other loans 
and expansion into the community. And that is really a key 
obstacle for us right now. So we would like to see that 
refinance rule revisited.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="104" speaker="Mr. BACON">Thank you. Great input.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="105" speaker="Mr. BACON">    Ms. McDonald?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="106" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> As I mentioned earlier, it would be great to
have any unwritten rules or best practices published so that we 
do not find out after the fact. It would save us a lot of time. 
It would save the SBA a lot of time.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="107" speaker="Mr. BACON"> I think everybody would like that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="108" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> Yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="109" speaker="Mr. BACON">Any job they are in.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="110" speaker="Mr. BACON">    Mr. Wilkinson?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="111" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">Well, mine is more at a programmatic level.
Over the last few years we have bumped into our authorization 
cap repeatedly, and we had proposed--last year it was included 
in--the budget request for the current year has been improved 
by OMB and actually was introduced in the Senate as potential 
language to give the administrator of the SBA the opportunity 
to increase our authorized cap with notice to the 
Appropriations Committees by a certain percentage, 10, 15 
percent. So, for instance, this year, she could raise it 
another $3 billion, or up to $3 billion with notification to 
the Appropriations Committee so long as the program is 
operating at a zero credit subsidy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="112" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">    So no appropriations are needed. It would give us that 
flexibility so we are not worrying about did we guess exactly 
right on the amount of loan volume we are going to see 18 
months down the road, because that is a hard task to do. And 
with that kind of flexibility in the authorization cap, it 
would make my life a lot easier.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="113" speaker="Mr. BACON"> Thank you. And with about the 40 seconds
remaining, Mr. Ashby?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="114" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> We are a portfolio lender. We are a small bank
and so I am kind of a small bank advocate. But I think one of 
the things that changed this past year was the inability for 
banks to write an SBA loan if it would get over their loans to 
one borrower limitation. And in a lot of these small 
communities that may have $100 million in assets and say $8 
million in capital, that does not give you a very large loan 
limit that you can make to some of these customers in your 
market that may actually need that loan. So I think for 
portfolio lenders it would be great if there could be a carve-
out for certain sized banks.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. BACON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="115" speaker="Mr. BACON"> Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate your
recommendations, and I yield back.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="116" speaker="Chairman KELLY">If it is okay with the panel, I think we
are going to do another round of questions. Ms. Adams and I 
have both agreed. Is that okay with you guys? And so I will 
recognize myself for 5 minutes.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="117" speaker="Chairman KELLY">My first question is, and we kind of talked around this, 
but is the Credit Elsewhere Test, is it strong enough? And I 
would just like to hear your comments on that.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="118" speaker="Chairman KELLY">    Mr. Wilkinson, I guess we will start with you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="119" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> Well, I think it is. Clearly, it is raising
a lot of questions here on the Hill as to whether it is or not. 
But I think from the lender's side we understand that we have 
to document in the file why that borrower cannot get 
conventional financing. And could we put some other language 
and statute to make that even more clear? That is a possibility 
and we would be happy to help draft some language with that, 
but it is pretty clear in our books. We treat what SBA means by 
credit elsewhere and the things that are detailed out in the 
SOP on how you document that.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="120" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> So you feel like it is strong enough and it
is clear enough that you understand it and it is the right test 
right now, is that correct?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="121" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> I understand it, and I think our members
understand it.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="122" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> Ms. Blankenship?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="123" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> I think it works for us right now. If you
look back at our historical volumes, they did not increase or 
decrease because of this test. And remember, when you are a 
small community bank, you have a fiduciary responsibility to 
your customer. I mean, we go to church and schools. Our kids go 
to school together. We cannot take advantage of our customer. 
So it is our job to put that customer in the right finance tool 
to get them their credit availability. Our reputation and 
integrity is riding on this as well.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="124" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> Mr. Ashby, do you agree?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="125" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> I agree. When you look at our percentage of
loans that we have with a SBA guarantee that are business-
related purposes, it is 19 percent. And so when you just look 
at the broad category of business opportunities in our area 
that is not as vibrant as others, that is a very believable 
percentage.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="126" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> And Ms. McDonald?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="127" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> I think everybody has said it really well. We
have a fiduciary duty to do the right thing. Everybody here 
agrees with that. We have to be able to note in the loan file 
or document the reasons why we went with an SBA loan, if we 
were ever audited, we can confidently give the information.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="128" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> Thank you. And I still start with you
again, Ms. McDonald, since I left you the last, my second 
question is does the SBA have the correct tools in place to 
provide oversight?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="129" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> I think so. We have a very good relationship
with the SBA. We are constantly talking to them about ways to 
improve the process. I would say yes.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="130" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> Mr. Ashby?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. ASHBY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="131" speaker="Mr. ASHBY"> Well, SBA has had explosive growth over the last
few years. You know, I think they are doing a good job. Mr. 
Wilkinson spoke to the PARRIS SCORE. And I do not know if those 
are confidential reports sent out quarterly to the banks that 
are participating in the programs, but they cover a lot of 
important things: your performance, your asset management and 
regulatory compliance risk management, and any special items 
and risk factors that the SBA sees out there. So I think it is 
well done.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="132" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> And either one of you two are welcome to
comment.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="133" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> Well, just as a preferred lender, you
know, we have to have integrity in our portfolio and meet 
certain standards and not go over loss ratios. So I think that 
the oversight is working for us now. With the growth in the 
program you may need to enhance the resources at SBA, but for 
players like us, I think we are not feeling lack of oversight.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="134" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">I think it is a critical part of our
business. We have a conference call every other week with the 
Office of Credit Risk Management to talk about issues that are 
out there. We stay very focused on oversight. Do they have 
enough tools and resources? We would like to see them. You 
know, they had approved prior to the hiring freeze six full-
time equivalents to come on to be the lead auditors. Right now 
they hire contractors to do those. Hopefully, when the hiring 
freeze is lifted, SBA can hire their own staff that is 
dedicated specifically for doing those reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="135" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">We hear from our members that a lot of times they are 
training the consultants on what they ought to be examining 
that lender for, which does not seem to work well at all. So we 
are hopeful that they will be able to get that done.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="136" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON">    We know that the Office of Credit Risk Management is 
supposed to get a certain allocation of resources every year. 
We would like to make sure that the Office of Credit Risk 
Management is actually getting those resources to make sure 
that they do have the tools necessary to stay on top of our 
growth.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="137" speaker="Chairman KELLY"> And I yield back. And now I recognize Ms.
Adams.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="138" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="139" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">    Ms. McDonald, credit unions are a vital part of our 
Nation's lending to small businesses and share the same 
mission, people helping people. How can Congress make it easier 
for credit unions to participate in SBA loans, SBA programs?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="140" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> Well, I think we have to look at raising the
member business cap. At Randolph Brooks, we are 6-1/2 percent 
loaned out, so we are not near the cap, but there are a lot of 
small credit unions out there who cannot get into SBA lending 
because as soon as they put in the resources and spend the 
money and spend the time, they get a couple of loans and then 
they would have to shut down their program.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="141" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. Encouraging more credit unions to
participate in SBA programs is critical to serving many 
businesses in underserved markets. So what impact will 
increased credit union participation mean to small firms?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="142" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> Well, it gives people the opportunity--it
gives credit unions the opportunity to serve their members. I 
mean, that is why Randolph Brooks got into member business 
lending. Our members were asking for this type of loan. And so 
the more players that are out there able to offer these loans, 
the more you are going to have them in the communities that we 
serve.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="143" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Let me ask. Do you all recruit members? You say
your members are asking. I am just curious.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="144" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> So we have membership, and we serve them for
their personal loans, their auto loans, their mortgage loans, 
and some of those same members, because they trust us, have 
come to us and say, you know, we would like to have our 
business needs served by you.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="145" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay. Do you do any special outreach or it is
kind of word of mouth?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. MCDONALD</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="146" speaker="Ms. MCDONALD"> Not particularly for business loans. We do
outreach for members in general and then they come to us for 
their business needs.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="147" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">Okay. Thank you.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="148" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">    Ms. Blankenship, in your written testimony, you note the 
increase in authorization for the 7(a) program that was 
required in July 2015. Could you please elaborate on the 
importance of stable funding and the proposal for a 2-year 
funding commitment?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. BLANKENSHIP</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="149" speaker="Ms. BLANKENSHIP"> Our loans go a loan committee and we
approve those loans in, let's just say it is 30 or 60 days in 
advance of closing the SBA loan. So at any given time we have 
approved loans that have not closed. And as Mr. Wilkinson said, 
sometimes those loans fall out. For whatever reason, they end 
up not closing. But we have this listing of loans that our loan 
committee has approved and we have told the customer was 
approved, but then in order to get it fully funded, we have to 
get the authorization from SBA. And so you are always fighting. 
We are trying to project, too, into the future, how much 
funding will be available based on the total market demand. And 
it is continually and annually a challenge that is I think 
particularly a challenge for smaller community banks and other 
SBA participant lenders. And if we could go to a 2-year 
funding, that would give us--the regulators like to see us plan 
and do our risk assessments annually, and it would just help us 
with our funds management, our liquidity, and our funding 
needs.
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Ms. ADAMS</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="150" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">Okay. Thank you very much.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="151" speaker="Ms. ADAMS">    Mr. Wilkinson, what efforts have the National Association 
of Government Guaranteed Lenders made to expand the universe of 
small business lending to traditionally underserved markets?
</paragraph>
    <speaker>Mr. WILKINSON</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="152" speaker="Mr. WILKINSON"> Thank you for that question. We have been
working diligently with the SBA on what we call our smart 
business toolkit. It is a program that we put together to help 
small businesses understand how to get credit ready, and we 
have paid for the underwriting of that course and have given it 
to SBA. We have had it translated into Spanish. We have been 
working with the Urban League to get that program out into 
their membership as well. We have had veteran outreach 
programs. We take lending to underserved markets very seriously 
and I think it is showing in that the numbers across the board 
are up in many of the underserved areas.

    <paragraph paraId="153" speaker="Ms. ADAMS"> Okay, great. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I
yield back. My time is up.

    <speaker>Chairman KELLY</speaker>
    <paragraph paraId="154" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I thank the ranking member and gentlelady
lady from North Carolina again. Thank you for today.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="155" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Thank you, witnesses, for being here today and sharing your 
thoughts and views. I believe it is important to hear directly 
from lenders participating in the program. Your role is 
extremely important to our hardworking small businesses that 
are striving every day to create themselves and to grow, to 
expand and create jobs for others in my district and the 
ranking member's district and in districts all across this 
great Nation. It is vital that the 7(a) Loan Program operate in 
an efficient manner and on behalf of all our small businesses 
and the American taxpayer. We will use this conversation from 
today as we continue to review and examine SBA's loan programs.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="156" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I ask unanimous consent that the members have 5 legislative 
days to submit statements and supporting materials for the 
record.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="157" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Without objection, so ordered.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="158" speaker="Chairman KELLY">This hearing is adjourned.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="159" speaker="Chairman KELLY">[Whereupon, at 12:04 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="160" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Alma Adams, and members of the 
Committee--my name is Tony Wilkinson and I am President and 
Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of 
Government Guaranteed Lenders (NAGGL), a national trade 
association of approximately 800 banks, credit unions, and non-
depository lenders who participate in the Small Business 
Administration's 7(a) loan guarantee program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="161" speaker="Chairman KELLY">The American entrepreneurial spirit is stronger than ever. 
Unfortunately, there is a very real gap in conventional bank 
lending in this country and even the most qualified business 
owners often struggle to secure financing that meets their 
business needs. A small business seeking capital is often 
offered loans with terms of 90-days to 3 years when they really 
need much longer term financing to thrive. The needs of this 
country's small businesses have always been a depository 
mismatch for banks that simply cannot, or may be reluctant to, 
tie up their capital in long-term loans for borrowers, 
especially in the wake of the Recession.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="162" speaker="Chairman KELLY">At the heart of the SBA's success is the 7(a) loan program, 
the agency's largest public-private partnership with close to 
2,000 active participating private-sector financial 
institutions. These lenders make private-sector loans to small 
business borrowers who are creditworthy and healthy, but that 
fall through the very wide and well-known lending gap that 
American small businesses face. Instead of 90-day to 3-year 
term loans, the 7(a) loan program loan has an average term of 
16 years--in other words, the kind of long-term financing that 
small businesses need to grow and thrive, but that generally 
cannot be found in the conventional market.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="163" speaker="Chairman KELLY">In Fiscal Year 2016, financial institutions large and small 
provided a little over $22.9 billion in loans to about 64,000 
small businesses nationwide through the 7(a) loan program. 
Unlike other federal programs that pass the cost on to the 
taxpayer, the 7(a) loan program is completely self-funded by 
the fees collected from lenders and borrowers. In fact, the 
7(a) loan program has returned more than $1.55 billion--that's 
with a ``b''--to the Treasury since Fiscal Year 2010. In other 
words, the 7(a) loan program is currently a revenue stream for 
the federal government.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="164" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Numbers don't lie. About 500,000 jobs are estimated to be 
created or retained annually thanks to the 7(a) loan program. 
In addition, there are other benefits that are often hard to 
measure, like increased tax revenue governments, and community 
growth driven by small business expansion in small towns across 
the country.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="165" speaker="Chairman KELLY">SBA 7(a) lending is a rare program where the federal agency 
has figured out how to get out of its own way and leverage 
private-sector expertise: lenders know how to make loans. SBA 
does not pick ``winners and losers'' because SBA does not make 
the loans and its 7(a) loan program is open to any eligible, 
creditworthy small business borrower. The 7(a) program does not 
supplant the lending market; it supplements it. SBA 
conditionally guarantees a percentage of the loan, leaving a 
healthy level of risk on the lenders as incentive to serve as 
prudent stewards of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="166" speaker="Chairman KELLY">I must stress this point because it is critical to 
understanding the lender's `skin in the game': SBA's guarantee 
is a contingent guarantee, which means that if a lender fails 
to fully follow 7(a) program requirements and meet its 
responsibilities, the SBA can--and does--reduce the amount of 
the guarantee payment to lenders. In the most egregious cases 
of imprudent lending, the SBA completely denies its liability 
under the guarantee. Therefore, the very nature of the 
guarantee relationship serves to assure that lenders comply 
with the various SBA regulations while engaging in quality 
lending. The guarantee program is a sharing of risk and not a 
complete transfer of risk. Beyond responsibilities to the SBA 
and the taxpayer, as responsible stewards of the program, 
lenders have an ongoing responsibility to their federal and 
state regulators, their internal regulatory oversight groups, 
and even their shareholders to ensure that safe and sound 
lending practices are maintained. In part, this `skin in the 
game' is what makes the private sector such ideal partners in 
the 7(a) loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="167" speaker="Chairman KELLY">NAGGL is pleased to testify in front of the Subcommittee on 
Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations because we recognize 
the benefit of quality lender oversight and strongly support 
the continuing implementation of SBA's oversight program. Since 
the introduction of federal credit reform, our member 
institutions have witnessed the impact that portfolio 
performance has on subsidy rates and program fees. And, just as 
important as maintaining healthy portfolio performance, proper 
lender oversight is needed to protect the main purpose of the 
7(a) loan program--its public policy mission to serve those 
small business borrowers in the community who cannot otherwise 
receive credit elsewhere on reasonable terms and conditions. An 
appropriate oversight approach must also include consideration 
of how well the public policy goals of the program are being 
met. In other words, effective oversight ensures that 
Congressional intent is met.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="168" speaker="Chairman KELLY">As Members of the House Small Business Committee, and of 
the Congress as a whole, the maintenance of the SBA programs 
and the responsibility to oversee the agency starts and stops 
with you. As the 7(a) lending industry, we strongly join you in 
calling on both SBA lending partners and the SBA itself to 
continue their efforts to maintain the integrity of the 
program. Our joint goal is for the 7(a) loan program to stand 
the test of time in order to serve many more thousands of small 
businesses across the country. And, NAGGL members fully 
understand that it is in their individual and collective best 
interests that SBA continue to engage in a sustained, effective 
lender oversight program to meet that goal.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="169" speaker="Chairman KELLY">History shows that the lending community is aware of the 
need to work with the SBA to police itself. For example, it was 
the 7(a) industry that raised concerns about the SBA's 
implementation and management of the now discontinued LowDoc 
Program soon after it was introduced. Why? There were no 
written policies for quite some time after the LowDoc pilot 
program was implemented. Similarly, in the 1990s, it was NAGGL 
that raised concerns to SBA and Congress about the practices of 
the industry's then largest lender. Also, in 2007, I testified 
before the Senate Small Business Committee to advocate for 
continued onsite reviews of 7(a) lenders, insisting that 
offsite reviews alone would not be enough to capture 
potentially risky behavior. I could go on, but the evidence is 
clear: lenders and the industry do care about the integrity of 
the 7(a) loan program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="170" speaker="Chairman KELLY">At the same time, it is also important that the lender 
oversight pendulum does not swing too far in the opposite 
direction resulting in lenders and borrowers finding the 
program unattractive, or resulting in duplication of existing 
oversight activities from other regulatory agencies (as well as 
a duplication of the costs already associated with those 
activities). It is an established fact that the bank and credit 
union industries already have substantial lender oversight from 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National 
Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Federal Reserve Board 
(FRB), and various state banking regulators. NAGGL has always 
believed that SBA should be required to demonstrate that it is 
adding value to current federal and state oversight efforts, 
not merely duplicating existing efforts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="171" speaker="Chairman KELLY">So, what is a current snapshot of SBA oversight? The SBA 
Office of Credit Risk Management (OCRM) is working overtime at 
smart, effective oversight of a fast-growing program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="172" speaker="Chairman KELLY">One notable improvement is OCRM's coordination with other 
federal bank regulators. In 2007, when testifying in the 
Senate, I advocated for SBA to partner with the federal and 
state banking regulators on procedures and lenders of interest 
to ensure that the safety and soundness testing of SBA 
portfolios was being conducted in a way that was consistent 
with the requirements imposed on participating lending partners 
by their regulators. I said then:</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="173" speaker="Chairman KELLY">``We recognize that an inter-regulatory agency</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="174" speaker="Chairman KELLY">partnership will require the commitment and cooperation</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="175" speaker="Chairman KELLY">of several agencies; however, we believe that this type</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="176" speaker="Chairman KELLY">of arrangement is necessary to provide the most cost</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="177" speaker="Chairman KELLY">effective and meaningful determination of risk. We</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="178" speaker="Chairman KELLY">would hope that the SBA is willing to pursue this</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="179" speaker="Chairman KELLY">avenue prior to arbitrarily requiring that</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="180" speaker="Chairman KELLY">participating lenders bear the cost of additional</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="181" speaker="Chairman KELLY">regulatory examination.''</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="182" speaker="Chairman KELLY">In the final months of 2016, nearly ten years after that 
testimony, SBA entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with 
the FDIC to coordinate information sharing on mutual `lenders 
of interest'. NAGGL continues to encourage SBA to negotiate 
similar MOUs with the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board. This 
kind of coordination reduces duplication of federal efforts and 
is critical to an SBA oversight process capable of keeping up 
with lending program growth.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="183" speaker="Chairman KELLY">It is important to note that just a decade ago, the SBA's 
oversight efforts only applied to the largest lenders, even 
though its own statistics showed lenders with portfolios under 
$1 million still pose a significant risk to the 7(a) loan 
program. And it was only recently, in December 2014, that the 
SBA created and implemented the PARRiS review system, a risk-
basked review protocol that oversees all 7(a) lenders and takes 
into account qualitative and quantitative performance data. 
PARRiS stands for ``Portfolio Performance,'' ``Asset 
Management,'' ``Regulatory Compliance,'' ``Risk Management,'' 
and ``Special Items.'' The PARRiS methodology is meant to 
better identify a lender's specific risk areas, assess the 
level of risk a lender poses to SBA, and to make 
recommendations for corrective action. Lenders are scored ``1'' 
through ``5'' as part of a data-driven lender-profile 
assessment. Lenders are also subject to multiple levels of 
scrutiny and reviews, from analytical and virtual to full 
onsite reviews.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="184" speaker="Chairman KELLY">By most regulatory practice standards, having been 
implemented just two years ago, the PARRiS system is in its 
infancy. We encourage you, as authorizers, to allow the PARRiS 
system to continuing to develop ever greater sophistication and 
to support SBA's ongoing improvement efforts. For instance, 
this past January and after nearly two years of advocacy on the 
issue, NAGGL successfully shepherded through a policy change in 
PARRiS that establishes a lender mission rating in the 
methodology used to risk rate lenders. Prior to this change, 
PARRiS' lender risk rating did not account for traditionally 
lower performance of loans to underserved markets, yet lenders 
were simultaneously strongly encouraged to focus on underserved 
markets. Now, with this policy change to PARRiS a reality, 
lenders are given ``credit'' if they meet certain benchmarks in 
lending to an underserved market (small loans, loans to rural 
communities, minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses, 
startups and export businesses)--in other words, the oversight 
review process will no longer be at odds with the public policy 
mission of SBA lending.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="185" speaker="Chairman KELLY">But these are only pieces of an effective lender oversight 
puzzle. Authorizers, appropriators, and the SBA must commit to 
an open flow of communication regarding what is needed to get 
the job done. For example, does OCRM have adequate resources to 
conduct the full range of their oversight activities? Is there 
enough OCRM staff? These questions are especially relevant as 
we see continued increased demand for the SBA programs from 
small business borrowers.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="186" speaker="Chairman KELLY">Since Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, the authorization cap has 
increased by 51% (Note: while the program operates at zero 
subsidy, it relies on an authorization cap set by the 
Committees on Appropriations in close conjunction when the 
authorizers every FY). The net dollars in loans that were 
disbursed from participating banks to small business borrowers, 
the amount of lending increased by about 28%. This growth is a 
result of a confluence of factors, but most pertinent to this 
conversation is that as a gap financing program lending where 
borrowers cannot find capital conventionally, we should be 
growing at a time when conventional lending to small businesses 
plummeted post-Recession and has yet to reach pre-Recession 
levels. The very fact that volume increased at a time when 
conventional lending receded from the market clearly 
demonstrates that the 7(a) loan program is indeed doing its job 
as a gap financing program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="187" speaker="Chairman KELLY">No one could predict how many small business borrowers 
would turn to the 7(a) loan program in the wake of the 
Recession, nor how many lenders would see the SBA as an avenue 
for being able to help small business borrowers that they were 
otherwise turning away. While the gap in access to capital has 
always existed for small business borrowers, the climate post-
Recession exacerbated this gap.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="188" speaker="Chairman KELLY">With the leadership and action of the House Small Business 
Committee, the Senate Small Business Committee, the House and 
Senate Committee on Appropriations, and House and Senate 
Leadership, the 7(a) program has continued to serve small 
business borrowers despite the fact that borrower demand 
reached the program's authorization cap prior to the end of the 
fiscal year in both FY 2014 and FY 2015. In both of those 
fiscal years, the House and Senate were able to pass language 
that allowed for the program to be reinstated and avoid a mid-
fiscal year shutdown. Allow me to take a moment to thank you 
all for your continued support of the program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="189" speaker="Chairman KELLY">7(a) volume is a sign of great success for the program. 
This period of growth is also the perfect time to ensure 
oversight is run appropriately as our potential balance sheet 
has more than doubled in size over approximately two-and-a-half 
years. As a trade association, NAGGL believes it is perfectly 
reasonable to ask questions about whether the oversight 
capabilities of SBA have grown commensurate with the increased 
volume of the lending program.</paragraph>
    <paragraph paraId="190" speaker="Chairman KELLY">NAGGL and SBA lenders are incredibly proud of who we serve 
and the role we play in each of your individual districts. Over 
the past several years, lending to nearly every underserved 
market--from veterans, rural communities, urban areas, women, 
Hispanics, and African Americans, to name a few--has increased. 
While we can always do more to improve access to capital to 
these markets, we are confident that the 7(a) lending industry 
is fulfilling the intent of Congress to serve the country's 
small businesses. Put simply, the issues that 7(a) loans solve 
are the issues that every Main Street across the country 
struggle with, and which every legislator, whether Republican 
or Democrat, wants to desperately find an answer to over the 
next four years--jobs, community rejuvenation, and opportunity.</paragraph>
