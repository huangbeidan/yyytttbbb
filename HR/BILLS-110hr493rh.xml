			 findings:</text>
			<paragraph id="H87465642021942779FB5A8A2B4ADFB5E"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Deciphering the sequence
			 of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new opportunities
			 for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness will
			 allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms have begun.
			 Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the likelihood
			 that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may
			 allow for the development of better therapies that are more effective against
			 disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments. These advances give
			 rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health
			 insurance and employment.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6BF6C3FFFE1C4F1C9BCD4038BF2D06CE"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The early science of
			 genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization of
			 persons having presumed genetic <quote>defects</quote> such as mental
			 retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other
			 conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in
			 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to
			 <quote>correct</quote> apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these
			 State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include
			 essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.
			 However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of
			 sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels
			 Congressional action in this area.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H9EEC863CC2724F509677C400C6C48497"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Although genes are
			 facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are associated
			 with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic
			 traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular group
			 may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic
			 information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw
			 the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a
			 disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began
			 to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began
			 mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia,
			 leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this
			 stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act,
			 which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is
			 voluntary.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA6A35378057B4F3FA501DE8C0024B5BD"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Congress has been
			 informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include
			 the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
			 which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case
			 Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir.
			 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear
			 of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and
			 health insurance.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HED65AE70554E488FA7A2FA26E78E111E"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Federal law addressing
			 genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is incomplete in both
			 the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have
			 enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws vary widely
			 with respect to their approach, application, and level of protection. Congress
			 has collected substantial evidence that the American public and the medical
			 community find the existing patchwork of State and Federal laws to be confusing
			 and inadequate to protect them from discrimination. Therefore Federal
			 legislation establishing a national and uniform basic standard is necessary to
			 fully protect the public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the
			 potential for discrimination, thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of
			 genetic testing, technologies, research, and new therapies.</text>

			 findings:</text>
			<paragraph id="H4B2C9C164F0C49BEAE4B00ADBB8CFDC3"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Deciphering the
			 sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new
			 opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of
			 illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms
			 have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the
			 likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about
			 genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more
			 effective against disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments.
			 These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to
			 discriminate in health insurance and employment.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HD88484295A014FC7A440A46ED74DFFC0"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The early science
			 of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization
			 of persons having presumed genetic <quote>defects</quote> such as mental
			 retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other
			 conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in
			 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to
			 <quote>correct</quote> apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these
			 State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include
			 essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.
			 However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of
			 sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels
			 Congressional action in this area.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H51018077EE5647A3001050C5778F322B"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Although genes
			 are facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are
			 associated with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some
			 genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular
			 group may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic
			 information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw
			 the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a
			 disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began
			 to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began
			 mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia,
			 leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this
			 stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act,
			 which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is
			 voluntary.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H67D9FB2EEC02452B8B68E0AF58793F14"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Congress has been
			 informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include
			 the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory,
			 which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case
			 Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir.
			 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear
			 of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and
			 health insurance.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0C8E88949329467EB400F4828CBBFD76"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Federal law
			 addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is
			 incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many
			 States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws
			 vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of
			 protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence that the American
			 public and the medical community find the existing patchwork of State and
			 Federal laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from
			 discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and
			 uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from
			 discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination,
			 thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing,
			 technologies, research, and new therapies.</text>

			 findings:</text>
			<paragraph id="H376F376E424248F0A6B00700001347F9"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Deciphering the
			 sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new
			 opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of
			 illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms
			 have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the
			 likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about
			 genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more
			 effective against disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments.
			 These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to
			 discriminate in health insurance and employment.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HC9C4645DCCAB403199D048013836CFB1"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The early
			 science of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the
			 sterilization of persons having presumed genetic <quote>defects</quote> such as
			 mental retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss,
			 among other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of
			 Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to
			 <quote>correct</quote> apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these
			 State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include
			 essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection.
			 However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of
			 sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels
			 Congressional action in this area.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H7AE945B22D224E48A41D2455AA16467C"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Although genes
			 are facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are
			 associated with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some
			 genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular
			 group may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic
			 information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw
			 the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a
			 disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began
			 to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began
			 mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia,
			 leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this
			 stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act,
			 which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is
			 voluntary.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA29C496D269D4EDE92EF74AC32B80005"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Congress has
			 been informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These
			 include the use of pre-employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley
			 Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that
			 case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th
			 Cir. 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the
			 fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and
			 health insurance.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H410D5C099908464BB6E0E5C15BBBDD91"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Federal law
			 addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is
			 incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many
			 States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws
			 vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of
			 protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence that the American
			 public and the medical community find the existing patchwork of State and
			 Federal laws to be confusing and inadequate to protect them from
			 discrimination. Therefore Federal legislation establishing a national and
			 uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from
			 discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination,
			 thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing,
			 technologies, research, and new therapies.</text>
