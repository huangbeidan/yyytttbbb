			 1996, issue of the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615â€“44618) for inclusion as
			 part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are consistent with the

			 forth in the amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of tobacco
			 products by the Food and Drug Administration, and the restriction on the sale

			 tobacco products contained in such regulations are substantially related to

			 described in paragraph (30) will directly and materially advance the Federal
			 Governmentâ€™s substantial interest in reducing the number of children and
			 adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in preventing the
			 life-threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use. An
			 overwhelming majority of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such
			 products while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in those
			 products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco advertising and promotion play
			 a crucial role in the decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products.
			 Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not and will not be
			 effective in reducing the problems addressed by such regulations. The
			 reasonable restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products
			 contained in such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the number
			 of minors using and becoming addicted to those products.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H7A8C3E7847264DF38559CBA3AC5B99E4"><enum>(32)</enum><text>The regulations

			 communication by tobacco manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce
			 the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco
			 and to prevent the life-threatening health consequences associated with tobacco
			 use. Such regulations are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and
			 promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or heard by youth and
			 most likely to entice them into tobacco use, while affording tobacco
			 manufacturers and sellers ample opportunity to convey information about their
			 products to adult consumers.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HF70C86725730482B923BE6E4ADB3A673"><enum>(33)</enum><text>Tobacco dependence is a

			</paragraph><paragraph id="H9A46237A759C4DD1B04BF03138B21BBD"><enum>(34)</enum><text>Because the only known

			</paragraph><paragraph id="H24ED259AD5BF423CBD57D47CDF39F313"><enum>(36)</enum><text>It is essential that the
			 Food and Drug Administration review products sold or distributed for use to
			 reduce risks or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be
			 empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such products. It is also
			 essential that manufacturers, prior to marketing such products, be required to
			 demonstrate that such products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and
			 will benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into account both
			 users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco
			 products.</text>

			 such risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the public health to
			 the extent that the individuals, who would otherwise not consume tobacco
			 products or would consume such products less, use tobacco products purporting
			 to reduce risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified risk
			 products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than quitting or reducing
			 their use of tobacco products, have a substantially increased likelihood of
			 suffering disability and premature death. The costs to society of the
			 widespread use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products that
			 do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include thousands of
			 unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs to our health care
			 system.</text>

			</paragraph><paragraph id="H139029148F6D42DDBEDB7F667E1F404C"><enum>(40)</enum><text>The dangers of products
			 sold or distributed as modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact
