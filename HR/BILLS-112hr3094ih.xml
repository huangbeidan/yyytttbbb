			 by striking the first sentence and inserting the following: <quote>In each
			 case, prior to an election, the Board shall determine, in order to assure to
			 employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this Act,
			 the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining. Unless
			 otherwise stated in this Act, the unit appropriate for purposes of collective
			 bargaining shall consist of employees that share a sufficient community of
			 interest. In determining whether employees share a sufficient community of
			 interest, the Board shall consider (1) similarity of wages, benefits, and
			 working conditions; (2) similarity of skills and training; (3) centrality of
			 management and common supervision; (4) extent of interchange and frequency of
			 contact between employees; (5) integration of the work flow and
			 interrelationship of the production process; (6) the consistency of the unit
			 with the employer’s organizational structure; (7) similarity of job functions
			 and work; and (8) the bargaining history in the particular unit and the
			 industry. To avoid the proliferation or fragmentation of bargaining units,
			 employees shall not be excluded from the unit unless the interests of the group
			 sought are sufficiently distinct from those of other employees to warrant the
			 establishment of a separate unit. Whether additional employees should be
			 included in a proposed unit shall be based on whether such additional employees
			 and proposed unit members share a sufficient community of interest, with the
			 sole exception of proposed accretions to an existing unit, in which the
			 inclusion of additional employees shall be based on whether such additional
			 employees and existing unit members share an overwhelming community of interest
			 and the additional employees have little or no separate identity.</quote>; and</text>
