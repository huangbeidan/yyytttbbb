<paragraph id="H6E32036067A04B5CAEF87FAAE329BEB5"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Because past efforts to restrict advertising and marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H1E77DA2D11454FABB5646847B9A94984"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and regulatory authority and resources they need to address comprehensively the public health and societal problems caused by the use of tobacco products.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H0198BF7E96BB4DA8AAA7CBAEEE68FB5"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Federal and State public health officials, the public health community, and the public at large recognize that the tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.</text></paragraph>

<paragraph id="HA2B6962C9D384C93BFFC468700398DB1"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce through the health care and other costs attributable to the use of tobacco products.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE47E7391A83A4E3484B5D980A670BBCE"><enum>(12)</enum><text>It is in the public interest for Congress to enact legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the advertising and promotion of such products.

<paragraph id="H8BE14B89A25E40DAA8852EAE014CDF5"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today’s children from becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to reduced health care costs.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE7BD8A27409B4E5CB369D2DF0900288D"><enum>(15)</enum><text>Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco products have been especially directed to attract young persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful in adequately preventing such increased use.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HD815D49B41784AC897C0ECD16088E286"><enum>(16)</enum><text>In 2003, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than $15,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HFA076D756F6B42469453001600616C57"><enum>(17)</enum><text>Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and healthful to minors.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE03C71B9A5EF40E58CBAC2FC9AEAAD4"><enum>(18)</enum><text>Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H92D78111E3A5438EBE100005DF1816A5"><enum>(19)</enum><text>Through advertisements during and sponsorship of sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting activity.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HAAD8611212BD4D248276664679E400F"><enum>(20)</enum><text>Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the number of young people who begin to use tobacco.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H44BC96B65EDF4844ADA8A00CBFFF955"><enum>(21)</enum><text>The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and encourages them to use tobacco products.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H59E4DE411E76470EB8CF320594E796BC"><enum>(22)</enum><text>Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco market by increasing consumption of tobacco products including tobacco use by young people.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HFFCDC44D5E09493DAA241607C5F8A0C1"><enum>(23)</enum><text>Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and older, smoke these same brands.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE490C272052E480BA1B674744D903EF3"><enum>(24)</enum><text>Tobacco company documents indicate that young people are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco market. Children, who tend to be more price-sensitive than adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H10328953504A4BF3AAF90000AE524524"><enum>(25)</enum><text>Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HA2CADEE3FE014648B8DEF37F72845949"><enum>(26)</enum><text>Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation prohibiting access to young people and providing for education about tobacco use.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HF344E86AA7F54945A244D2C684995F00"><enum>(27)</enum><text>International experience shows that advertising regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people’s use than weaker or less comprehensive ones.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H5B967CA5CB0042B584EE2CC300557C12"><enum>(28)</enum><text>Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while preserving the informational function of advertising.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HB1C59B7ED5A64119B67216A601053EBA"><enum>(29)</enum><text>It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt legislation to address the public health crisis created by actions of the tobacco industry.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H5BE3C830B78241EE913CA7DC70C6527B"><enum>(30)</enum><text>The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615–44618) for inclusion as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are consistent with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and with the standards set forth in the amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration and the restriction on the sale and distribution, including access to and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products contained in such regulations are substantially related to accomplishing the public health goals of this Act.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H01C4779991B44848859228286281B8AD"><enum>(31)</enum><text>The regulations described in paragraph (30) will directly and materially advance the Federal Government’s substantial interest in reducing the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in preventing the life-threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the number of minors using and becoming addicted to those products.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H955F4E136A2147A593C47998D073DA58"><enum>(32)</enum><text>The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample opportunity to convey information about their products to adult consumers.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H38B4815033AB458AA9E400ECA9113FAB"><enum>(33)</enum><text>Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-term or permanent abstinence.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H4A68CF5617214400B699B61340033706"><enum>(34)</enum><text>Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help them quit completely.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H824EF1C6B2514612A8B7C859E144D882"><enum>(35)</enum><text>Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and finance criminal activities both domestically and internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H194E3F3495E942509CFDAC897147751D"><enum>(36)</enum><text>It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not currently use tobacco products.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HACDAC7B35C5A4F8293035879071F50A8"><enum>(37)</enum><text>Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the public health to the extent that the individuals, who would otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability and premature death.
