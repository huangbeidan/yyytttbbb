			 gain financially from lending to poor countries that have benefited from debt
			 relief without having paid for past debt relief or facing the prospect of
			 paying for the future relief of unsustainable and irresponsible new lending. In
			 these cases, the gains of debt relief for poor debtor countries are at risk of
			 being eroded. This takes the form of new lending to countries that have
			 received debt cancellation from countries including China.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H642375B620F7459C87D759023F06C04E"><enum>(10)</enum><text>It is also essential
			 that all lenders and borrowers accept co-responsibility and learn from past
			 mistakes—as evidenced by the debt crisis itself—by making more productive
			 investment choices and engaging in more responsible lending and borrowing in
			 the future. In October 2006, Norway became the first creditor to accept
			 co-responsibility for past lending mistakes and cancelled the debt of 5 nations
			 on the grounds that the loans reflected poor development policy.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H8E76F9916212464D916765A8D6C785A0"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">A growing number of governments and
			 intergovernmental bodies, including the United Kingdom, the European
			 Commission, and Norway, are raising concerns about the harmful impacts of
			 economic policy conditionality. Many impoverished countries that have received
			 debt cancellation under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives have done so at a high
			 social cost, because they have had to implement economic policy conditions such
			 as privatization of public utilities and other basic services, adhere to budget
			 ceilings imposed by the IMF, and comply with other harmful requirements. Some
			 of these policies have had the effect of limiting fiscal space for productive
			 investment and threatening growth and human development. Several countries
			 currently eligible for debt cancellation under the HIPC or MDRI programs are
			 facing extended delays in receiving cancellation because they are struggling to
			 comply with such requirements from the IMF and World Bank.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H5A4660075AC84C10AC2B18EAA64D1E3E"><enum>(12)</enum><text>There is also an urgent
			 need to look beyond the constraints of current debt relief initiatives to
			 address the need for expanded debt cancellation. The current initiatives allow
			 countries to qualify for relief based on economic criteria rather than human
			 needs. A January 2007 report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found
			 that eligibility for debt cancellation should be expanded to cover all
			 low-income countries.</text>
