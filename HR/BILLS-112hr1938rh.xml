			 following:</text>
			<paragraph id="H3A8CAEC01AC74C00AC04C8170202D7B0"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The United States
			 currently imports more than half of the oil it consumes, often from countries
			 hostile to United States interests or with political and economic instability
			 that compromises supply security.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAC684B3BAB174DFA939FB1483E026DA1"><enum>(2)</enum><text>While a significant
			 portion of imports are derived from allies such as Canada and Mexico, the
			 United States remains vulnerable to substantial supply disruptions created by
			 geopolitical tumult in major producing nations.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H04BE67E28D2A472CAFA60A5FF4B57710"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Strong increases in oil
			 consumption in the developing world outpace growth in conventional oil
			 supplies, bringing tight market conditions and higher oil prices in periods of
			 global economic expansion or when supplies are threatened.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HE6120FDF75434A5FA53034BA2F1718E2"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The development and
			 delivery of oil and gas from Canada to the United States is in the national
			 interest of the United States in order to secure oil supplies to fill needs
			 that are projected to otherwise be filled by increases in other foreign
			 supplies, notably from the Middle East.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAA40DB7165AF4283A16D6A3833BBBD67"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Continued development of
			 North American energy resources, including Canadian oil, increases domestic
			 refiners’ access to stable and reliable sources of crude and improves certainty
			 of fuel supply for the Department of Defense, the largest consumer of petroleum
			 in the United States.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H5D0030CB1B0843958A657D3CE514FF7A"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Canada and the United
			 States have the world’s largest two-way trading relationship. Therefore, for
			 every United States dollar spent on products from Canada, including oil, 90
			 cents is returned to the United States economy. When the same metrics are
			 applied to trading relationships with some other major sources of United States
			 crude oil imports, returns are much lower.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HC57C5AF41F804FF4A05DF5B2D6FE27D6"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The principal choice for
			 Canadian oil exporters is between moving increasing crude oil volumes to the
			 United States or Asia, led by China. Increased Canadian oil exports to China
			 will result in increased United States crude oil imports from other foreign
			 sources, especially the Middle East.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6E97898C48F74132B460F19A9664B791"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Increased Canadian crude
			 oil imports into the United States correspondingly reduce the scale of
			 <quote>wealth transfers</quote> to other more distant foreign sources resulting
			 from the greater cost of importing crude oil from those sources.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HBDA4C59FB4E649FC8EEF35FC71C914D7"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Not only are United
			 States companies major investors in Canadian oil sands, but many United States
			 businesses throughout the country benefit from supplying goods and services
			 required for ongoing Canadian oil sands operations and expansion.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB3650D5D13F14A538DFCA9F412CB1F0E"><enum>(10)</enum><text>There has been more than
			 2 years of consideration and a coordinated review by more than a dozen Federal
			 agencies of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and
			 economic impacts of the proposed pipeline project known as the Keystone XL from
			 Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Nebraska, and then on to the United States
			 Gulf Coast through Cushing, Oklahoma.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HEEED0053D2394BDCAB9FB50C08D6AC4E"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Keystone XL represents a
			 high capacity pipeline supply option that could meet early as well as long-term
			 market demand for crude oil to United States refineries, and could also
			 potentially bring over 100,000 barrels per day of United States Bakken crudes
			 to market.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H7735A1D144C24C8EA623D1115FEC3E65"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Completion of the
			 Keystone XL pipeline would increase total Keystone pipeline capacity by 700,000
			 barrels per day to 1,290,000 barrels per day.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H1F1B32364FA9443EACAC8BD21EEA9D6D"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The Keystone XL pipeline
			 would provide short-term and long-term employment opportunities and related
			 labor income benefits, as well as government revenues associated with sales and
			 payroll taxes.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H201BD47BDCF6402B82B549A97859DFF5"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The earliest possible
			 construction of the Keystone XL pipeline will make the extensive proven and
			 potential reserves of Canadian oil available for United States use and increase
			 United States jobs and will therefore serve the national interest.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB23D7A12D8DA4B30BEE4F5219F5A39E0"><enum>(15)</enum><text>Analysis using the
			 Environmental Protection Agency models shows that the Keystone XL pipeline will
			 result in no significant change in total United States or global greenhouse gas
			 emissions.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0133F949D6B845D6BB1078CFAD44932C"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The Keystone XL pipeline
			 would be state-of-the-art and have a degree of safety higher than any other
			 typically constructed domestic oil pipeline system.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H54035A6F1EBB47E495DD6238B925877A"><enum>(17)</enum><text>Because of the extensive
			 governmental studies already made with respect to the Keystone XL project and
			 the national interest in early delivery of Canadian oil to United States
			 markets, a decision with respect to a Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL
			 pipeline should be promptly issued without further administrative delay or
			 impediment.</text>
