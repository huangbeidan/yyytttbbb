			 infrastructure to try to ease acute electricity shortages, as well as primary
			 education, malaria control, healthcare and water infrastructure (specifically
			 targeting the poor and under-served villages). Zambia is using its savings of

			</paragraph><paragraph id="H5B9FEBAFB0E944E595FE7E86EAB375F9"><enum>(9)</enum><text>A
			 critical issue which needs to be addressed on debt is the way that
			 non-concessional lenders stand to gain financially from lending to poor
			 countries that have benefited from debt relief without having paid for past
			 debt relief or facing the prospect of paying for the future relief of
			 unsustainable and irresponsible new lending. In these cases, the gains of debt
			 relief for poor debtor countries are at risk of being eroded. This takes the
			 form of new lending to countries that have received debt cancellation from
			 countries including China.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H642375B620F7459C87D759023F06C04E"><enum>(10)</enum><text>It is also
			 essential that all lenders and borrowers accept co-responsibility and learn
			 from past mistakes—as evidenced by the debt crisis itself—by making more
			 productive investment choices and engaging in more responsible lending and
			 borrowing in the future. In October 2006, Norway became the first creditor to
			 accept co-responsibility for past lending mistakes and cancelled the debt of 5
			 nations on the grounds that the loans reflected poor development policy.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H8E76F9916212464D916765A8D6C785A0"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">A growing number of governments and
			 intergovernmental bodies, including the United Kingdom, the European
			 Commission, and Norway, are raising concerns about the harmful impacts of
			 certain economic policy conditionalities. Many impoverished countries that have
			 received debt cancellation under the HIPC and MDRI initiatives have done so at
			 a high social cost, because they have had to implement certain economic policy
			 conditions, including the privatization of essential basic services such as
			 water, and comply with other harmful requirements. Some of these policies have
			 had the effect of limiting fiscal space for productive investment and
			 threatening growth and human development. Several countries currently eligible
			 for debt cancellation under the HIPC or MDRI programs are facing extended
			 delays in receiving cancellation because they are struggling to comply with
			 such requirements from the IMF and World Bank.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H5A4660075AC84C10AC2B18EAA64D1E3E"><enum>(12)</enum><text>There is also an
			 urgent need to look beyond the constraints of current debt relief initiatives
			 to address the need for expanded debt cancellation. The current initiatives
			 allow countries to qualify for relief based on economic criteria rather than
			 human needs. A January 2007 report by the United Nations Human Rights Council
			 found that eligibility for debt cancellation should be expanded to cover all
			 low-income countries.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H849B94140388477B8D24C6B8F54F548C"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The Government of
			 the United Kingdom has proposed that qualification for the MDRI be extended to
			 the 67 nations which qualify for assistance exclusively from the International
			 Development Association. To be eligible for cancellation, countries must meet
			 economic criteria pertaining to public financial management, anti-corruption
