 <paragraph id="H5593257EF60048B8B5C40135BB930269"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Companies engaged in interstate commerce and publicly traded on national exchanges face unique challenges, operating often in every United States jurisdiction, under a variety of civil securities fraud statutes (<quote>blue sky laws</quote>) that can overlap or contradict each other and Federal law.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDE892923D56B4545BB7E88C82F51EF73"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Civil and criminal fraud have inherent differences in affect and burden of proof. States have a unique interest in prosecuting criminal fraud that should be maintained.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HBDC24D556BD34223993C8C101EE2255A"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Imposing differing State regulatory requirements for civil securities fraud on national markets increases risk, creates inefficiencies, raises costs, and can harm the efficient operation of these critical markets, without providing material investor protection benefits.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H87D4EF2C91D94C9E8F03FB3C629F2DFD"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Complying with dual regulatory regimes places America’s public companies at a unique competitive disadvantage in an increasing global marketplace.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H10E4699D185A454C97183B24AE7BBDB1"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Reputational risk for United States publicly traded companies accused of <quote>civil fraud</quote> in State civil enforcement actions, often based on State law standards that differ from Federal law that otherwise governs these national markets, can cause immediate and irreparable financial harm to shareholders and unnecessary loss of jobs, even after such allegations are later found to be baseless.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD586E3F1BD7240769A2919D4CF5E30DB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>As of June 2017, there were 5,734 public companies, little more than in 1982, when the economy was less than half its current size. The lack of a uniform standard for public companies is a contributing factor to the declining interest in the United States public market, harming the United States economy and reducing investment opportunities for the United States public.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H52B2B2F58ABF400C8111F33CBFF8C556"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The Commerce Clause, found in article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution, explicitly states that the United States Congress shall have power <quote>To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes</quote>. Interstate Commerce is an explicitly Federal responsibility, and companies actively engaging in commerce across State lines and raising capital on national markets should be primarily regulated by the Federal Government’s uniform anti-fraud standard.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H588D5E84721141BBA539E0CC5DD81CFF"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In the past, Congress has exercised this authority in regards to State securities preemption with both the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (<quote>PSLRA</quote>), which was designed to curb abusive Federal class actions (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/104/67">Public Law 104–67</external-xref>), and the National Securities Markets Improvements Act (<quote>NSMIA</quote>) to ensure that States could not impose their own views of what should or should not be included in registration statements filed in connection with nationally traded securities (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/104/290">Public Law 104–290</external-xref>).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF400F45F31E34F2CA844B87ACF07EA05"><enum>(9)</enum><text>It is in the public interest to establish preemption of Federal regulators and courts over civil securities fraud, eliminating concurrent Federal and State jurisdiction over the specific companies covered by this Act.</text>
