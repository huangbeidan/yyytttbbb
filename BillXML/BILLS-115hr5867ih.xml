 <paragraph id="H190E6B8E9B6144EFA870FBFAA9EED5A2"><enum>(1)</enum><text>On May 23, 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Office of the Inspector General in a letter to Senators Klobuchar, Durbin, and Shaheen, found that different vial sizes in addition to those currently approved and marketed in the United States could sometimes significantly reduce the amount of drug discards, or waste, from single-use vials.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HBBB95EF976964F7ABD5742DC999AF3D9"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Office of Inspector General analyzed 20 single-use vial drugs with the highest amounts of identifiable reimbursement for discarded drugs during 2013 and 2014 and found that the Medicare part B program paid $11,600,000,000 for these drugs, $2,100,000,000 of which was for drugs billed in increments of other-than-full vials, and $195,000,000, or nearly 10 percent, of the $2,100,000,000 billed in increments of other-than-full vials was reimbursed for discarded drugs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE42A061EA65047C9B6F16FF3CE19F511"><enum>(3)</enum><text>During the Food and Drug Administration’s review process for a drug’s safety and efficacy before a drug is approved for marketing in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration reviews the manufacturer’s proposed vial size.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H6C301D23FCC1470DBB1EBA1A7592658F"><enum>(4)</enum><text>As of January 1, 2017, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services requires all physicians, hospitals, and other providers submitting claims to Medicare to separately identify the discarded amount of a drug from a single-use vial (the JW modifier) on its claim for reimbursement by Medicare. The new requirement does not change the amount the providers are reimbursed for single-use drugs.</text>
