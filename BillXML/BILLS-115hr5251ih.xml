 <paragraph id="H36E5087258F64BF0962B3292A733C0E7"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The National Association of School Nurses identifies schools as primary locations to address student health issues, since a school nurse is the health care provider that many students see on the most regular basis.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H663EB803EB054049A346E73C55BCA943"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The American Academy of Pediatrics has recognized the crucial role that school nurses play in children’s health and has called for having a full-time school nurse every day and in every school building.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="H60C3326289CF428392955BE5FDDC4FF7"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The school nurse functions as the leader and coordinator of the school health services team, including by carrying out chronic disease management and health promotion as well as facilitating access to a medical home for each child and supporting academic achievement.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4F0E8FF0542D4F7D8E4AB28E39892F6E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>School nurses promote wellness and disease prevention to improve health outcomes for our Nation’s children. In addition, school nurses perform early intervention services such as periodic assessments for vision, hearing, and dental problems, in an effort to remove barriers to learning.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDF8AA10184644235B2FD676F1BEB2570"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The American Federation of Teachers has called for a nurse in every school, as nurses are front-line workers that address an array of health needs and their presence in a school can help to improve student learning.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="HCF963F008EFA482687F81BD8BA4EABE5"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to 2017 data from the National Association of School Nurses, only 39.3 percent of schools employ a full-time school nurse, while 35.5 percent of schools employ a school nurse only part-time, and 25.2 percent do not have a school nurse at all.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF237328141F8427BBFDB9709820D69FE"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The National Association of School Nurses has reported that medication administration to students is one of the most common health-related activities performed in school. As more chronically ill and medically unstable children enter the school system each year, the medical factors that promote and support their academic success increase, including the need for medications that enhance overall health or stabilize chronic conditions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="H4AC3842AD43841B18A9C8225E35FBDC5"><enum>(8)</enum><text>National data indicate that between 15 and 20 percent of children who spend their day in school have a chronic health condition.</text>

School nurses are actively engaged members of school-based mental health teams and spend nearly 32 percent of their time providing mental health services, including universal and targeted interventions, screenings to identify early warning signs and provide referrals to medical providers, and crisis planning.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB49230784ABF453A8D9E53EB8BB62F5C"><enum>(10)</enum><text>According to the Department of Education, during the 2013–2014 school year, 1,360,747 children enrolled in public schools experienced homelessness. Homeless children develop increased rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and the stress of their living situation can negatively affect their development and ability to learn. As a result, schools have become the primary access to health care for many children and adolescents. School nurses serve on the front lines as a safety net for the Nation’s most vulnerable children.</text>
