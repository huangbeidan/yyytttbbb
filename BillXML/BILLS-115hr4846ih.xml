<paragraph id="HE9A38933024A4265A9CAB4D941B3241F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Labor-management relationships and partnerships are based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a quality work environment. In many public safety agencies, it is the union that provides the institutional stability as elected leaders and appointees come and go.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HD13759C1B4A948529EA379E765B6A984"><enum>(2)</enum><text>State and local public safety officers play an essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, as first responders, are a component of our Nation’s National Incident Management System, developed by the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the National interest.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H58C38C6F80B64F9DB99B15D2E247D634"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, mediation, and arbitration to aid and encourage employers and the representatives of their employees to reach and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the settlement of disputes.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HA99E7DDC66584E98B58DA2C653126FBF"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The absence of adequate cooperation between public safety employers and employees has implications for the security of employees and can affect interstate and intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services of local communities, the health and well-being of public safety officers, and the morale of law enforcement, fire, and EMS departments. Additionally, these factors could have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, providing minimal standards for collective bargaining negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent industrial strife between labor and management that interferes with the normal flow of commerce.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE0F1E4FEAF254D4EBC60134B70E4BB02"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Many States and localities already provide public safety officers with collective bargaining rights comparable to or greater than the rights and responsibilities set forth in this Act, and such State and local laws should be respected.</text></paragraph></section> <section id="H3AF393A81A5A40BF8A7F89F4D17CC50E"><enum>3.</enum><header>Definitions</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">In this Act:</text>
