 <paragraph id="H419F50C654324FBA8643A9C23542CA9E"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Competition is a critical for promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, creating economic opportunity and spurring growth, promoting an equitable distribution of wealth, and ensuring choice for consumers and workers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF525D8F7D20742848C1F97A4967AD4F8"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Growing concerns over declining competition are driven by evidence of higher levels of concentration, slower rates of market entry, and widening inequality gaps. Evidence also shows a decline in business dynamism, which reduces the mobility of workers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA5132EA6A69E4225A87FE9896120E4B9"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In competitive labor markets, employers compete hard to provide better wages, benefits, and conditions for workers. In the absence of competition, employers in concentrated labor markets have monopsony power. If exercised, monopsony power allows employers to dictate wages and other critical factors to the detriment of workers. Employers with market power may also use anticompetitive contracts to restrict the opportunity and mobility of workers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDDA4C9421657485AB9955B201D9EE838"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Much like monopoly power, the exercise of monopsony power can harm workers, consumers, innovation, and economic growth.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H60DF5DE5FBB548359F3C5146B81C2EAB"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The antitrust laws are an important tool for promoting competition in all markets, including markets for consumer goods and services, and for inputs, including labor.</text>
