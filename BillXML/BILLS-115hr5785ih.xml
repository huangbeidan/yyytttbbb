Industrial and agricultural production skyrocketed. The poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared, and Western Europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HCCC785150B154857B4894EBE7D016D22"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Whitney M. Young, who served as executive director of the National Urban League from 1961 to 1971, first proposed a domestic Marshall Plan in 1964. Many elements of his plan, which called for $145 billion in spending over 10 years, were incorporated into President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty legislation.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H1037057DFB7F43A19EEB389E27F4FF0F"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the 1990 edition of the State of Black America, National Urban League President John Jacob again called for an urban Marshall Plan.</text> </paragraph>

<paragraph id="HE86F34F07EBE43E9B6992BDAE01C1354"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Unemployment remains particularly acute among African American youth between the ages of 16 and 19. As of March 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Black youth unemployment rate of those ages is 27.9 percent compared with 10.7 percent for White youth of this age.

Minorities own half as many businesses as non-minorities.

The median earnings of young adult high school completers were 20 percent higher than the median earnings of those without a high school credential ($25,000). Today, median lifetime earnings for those with a bachelor’s degree are $2,300,000 or 74 percent more than those with just a high school diploma.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H2D0F05178BF04F3BBC09D39783E4A44C"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Despite overall gains nationally, gaps in college enrollment and completion by race persist. In 2016, college enrollment for White students was 71 percent, which was a six percent increase from 2000. From 2000 to 2015, enrollment of Black students went from 30.5 percent to 34.9 percent, and enrollment of Latino students went from 21.7 percent to 36.6 percent. Nationally, over two-thirds of all Asian and White students complete college within six years compared to less than half of all Black and Latino students.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H356102D2962541669C71CAD5F2C5F123"><enum>(14)</enum><text>America’s public school population is majority minority and in 2044, the United States is expected to be a majority-minority nation where Whites will make up less than half of the population. Given this seismic shift in demographics, we must be more intentional about improving college readiness in our nation’s elementary and secondary schools and promoting access and success to post-secondary education for historically underrepresented students.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H494F6345D4E84F6C93E1135F7FD2ED89"><enum>(15)</enum><text>Homeownership is the primary means of building equity and passing on wealth from one generation to the next. This is especially true for African Americans, where over 90 percent of wealth is in their homes, according to the Center for Global Policy Solutions.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H1B7B66481EFC4EE699D7C9F35506ACF3"><enum>(16)</enum><text>Yet, African-American homeowners were three times more likely to be steered into subprime products, even when they qualified for conventional mortgages, in the years leading up to the financial crisis. The foreclosure rate for these loans was 10 times greater than conventional mortgages. Consequently, while the African-American homeownership rate peaked in 2004 at 50 percent, it is currently only 41.2 percent and is projected to decrease to 40 percent by 2030. Reversing this trend is vital to American families, to communities, and to our national economy.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HE57AFC11889D40DB9D199D6FD2A568DE"><enum>(17)</enum><text>The United States needs a domestic Mainstream Marshall plan that will combat poverty, promote equality and eliminate racial disparities.</text> </paragraph></subsection></section>

<paragraph id="HE9BF64038AD34754A6CA55F3F67B8587"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Our nation’s infrastructure serves as the arteries that move people, goods, and information across our country. A strong infrastructure network is critically important to the growth of our economy and the overall health of each and every American. This is especially true for Americans in low-income and otherwise vulnerable communities struggling to access the rest of the world.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H1D0F87A8AE4C498080A7C5586C680469"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In the traditional sense, the term <term>infrastructure</term> has been largely understood to include our transportation infrastructure (roads, bridges, rails, airports, ports/waterways), electrical grid, telecommunications (landline phone, cable, satellite), and public buildings. A 21st Century economy demands a broader, more inclusive definition to ensure that we are fully considering all of our infrastructure needs. A newer definition should be expanded to include the following: energy-efficient housing; broadband; educational facilities, including access to traditional universities and community colleges, as well as Historically Black Colleges and Universities; forest roads and sidewalks/bike trails; parks; waste removal and treatment facilities; and programs connecting seniors to their communities.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H334A1440BD534EF5B9D395C1FA74F76B"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Any effort to rebuild our nation’s crumbling infrastructure must include robust federal funding. Privatizing our nation’s infrastructure revitalization would shift the burden to cash-strapped states and cities while leaving out communities with the greatest need: rural and low-income populations. Additionally, states and cities are less likely to take a regional approach to investment, which is critical to ensuring national connectivity. Public-private partnerships (P3s) have limited success funding infrastructure projects. They are more expensive than conventional funding, often limiting competition and creating potential conflicts of interest. P3s would likely only consider projects that can provide a return on investment, as opposed to the broad infrastructure modernization this country desperately needs. Ultimately, private infrastructure investment would only fund a narrow scope of projects and the limited projects fortunate enough to attract private funding would tax the very people they are intended to benefit through tolls and user fees.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HA60F82903CCF4E36881620CDB48C9F8F"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Ensuring long-term investment is equally important to ensuring that investment is backed by robust public funding. Delivering reliable infrastructure requires the certainty and confidence that can only come with long-term funding. Congress needs to do away with short-term extensions and provide long-term authorization and spending measures that will authorize and fund our nation’s highway, public transit, aviation, and water infrastructure programs and projects at levels that are meaningful over the long-term.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H45D83F72F5CB457DB76B290B5D4B3B62"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Minority contractors should have the opportunity to rebuild their communities and employ hardworking Americans along the way. Infrastructure investments should be disseminated through a transparent procurement process with aggressive contracting goals for Disadvantaged Business Entities and effective enforcement to root out fraudulent firms. Contractors and subcontractors should have the ability to employ local hiring preferences and subcontractors should receive prompt payment when services are rendered.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H6F72F4F9039E4DA985F3CDF596BC7C8F"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Infrastructure development should be inclusive of underserved segments of the population, such as poor, rural, and elderly communities. Often times, infrastructure planning does not benefit the poorest communities and the infrastructure workforce traditionally lacks gender and racial diversity. A 21st Century economy should not exclude individuals from participation on the basis of demographics, geography, or financial means. Any infrastructure package must include innovative job training and workforce development initiatives to promote a diverse and inclusive labor pool. By ensuring participation from all individuals, we can provide equal opportunity for each and every American to contribute in meaningful ways to both the economy and the communities they call home.</text> </paragraph>

More intense storms, rising sea levels, storm surges, and other unusual weather conditions are placing an immense strain on our nation’s infrastructure and the limited resources that we have to build and maintain it. As we plan for the future and conceptualize how we will build up our infrastructure, we need to consider the long-term viability of these projects to ensure that they are resilient to extreme weather.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H6A52184FDAC54BE79ACDEFD15E00812E"><enum>(8)</enum><text>A robust transportation network must consider the changing demographics of its users and the subsequent changes in demand. Conventional transportation planning relies heavily on motor vehicle traffic. However, many communities—particularly in urban areas—must now consider pedestrians, cyclists, public transit riders, ridesharing, and other users when evaluating the effectiveness of the transportation ecosystem.</text> </paragraph>

This is especially the case when it comes to the program’s funding of hundreds of regional antidrug task forces because the grants for these antidrug task forces have been dispensed to State governments with very little Federal oversight and have been prone to misuse and corruption.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HCF0B5CF80B16457CB36B80598617BB83"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Numerous Government Accountability Office reports have found that the Department of Justice has inadequately monitored grants provided under the Byrne grants program. A 2001 General Accounting Office report found that one-third of the grants did not contain required monitoring plans. Seventy percent of files on such grants did not contain required progress reports. Forty-one percent of such files did not contain financial reports covering the full grant period. A 2002 report by the Heritage Foundation reported that <quote>there is virtually no evidence</quote> that the Byrne grants program has been successful in reducing crime and that the program lacks <quote>adequate measures of performance</quote>.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HAA28A23F83244C6CA87F2874E751C115"><enum>(3)</enum><text>A 2002 report by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas identified 17 recent scandals involving antidrug task forces in Texas that receive funds under the Byrne grants program. Such scandals include cases of the falsification of government records, witness tampering, fabricating evidence, false imprisonment, stealing drugs from evidence lockers, selling drugs to children, large-scale racial profiling, sexual harassment, and other abuses of official capacity. Recent scandals in other States include the misuse of millions of dollars in Byrne grants program money in Kentucky and Massachusetts, wrongful convictions based on police perjury in Missouri, and negotiations with drug offenders to drop or lower their charges in exchange for money or vehicles in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HDCD9AC886E45410EA4E992569A413D7C"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The most well-known Byrne-funded task force scandal occurred in Tulia, Texas, where dozens of African American residents (totaling over 16 percent of the town’s African American population) were arrested, prosecuted, and sentenced to decades in prison, based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of one undercover officer whose background included past allegations of misconduct, sexual harassment, unpaid debts, and habitual use of a racial epithet. The undercover officer was allowed to work alone, and not required to provide audiotapes, video surveillance, or eyewitnesses to corroborate his allegations. Despite the lack of physical evidence or corroboration, the charges were vigorously prosecuted. After the first few trials resulted in convictions and lengthy sentences, many defendants accepted plea bargains. Suspicions regarding the legitimacy of the charges eventually arose after two of the accused defendants were able to produce convincing alibi evidence to prove that they were out of State or at work at the time of the alleged drug purchases. Texas Governor Rick Perry eventually pardoned the Tulia defendants (after four years of imprisonment), but these kinds of scandals continue to plague Byrne grant program spending.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HF8E5A082B85A4580ABAC78E21944A683"><enum>(5)</enum><text>A case arose in a Federal court in Waco, Texas concerning the wrongful arrests of 28 African Americans out of 4,500 other residents of Hearne, Texas. In November 2000 these individuals were arrested on charges of possession or distribution of crack cocaine, and they subsequently filed a case against the county government. On May 11, 2005, a magistrate judge found sufficient evidence that a Byrne-funded anti-drug task force had routinely targeted African Americans to hold the county liable for the harm suffered by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in that lawsuit alleged that for the past 15 years, based on the uncorroborated tales of informants, task force members annually raided the African American community in eastern Hearne to arrest the residents identified by the confidential informants, resulting in the arrest and prosecution of innocent citizens without cause. On the eve of trial the counties involved in the Hearne task force scandal settled the case, agreeing to pay financial damages to the plaintiffs.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HDC34DA486453425A819FCF53DB411B3E"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Scandals related to the Byrne grants program have grown so prolific that the Texas legislature has passed several reforms in response to them, including outlawing racial profiling and changing Texas law to prohibit drug offense convictions based solely on the word of an undercover informant. The Criminal Jurisprudence Committee of the Texas House of Representatives issued a report in 2004 recommending that all of the State’s federally funded antidrug task forces be abolished because they are inherently prone to corruption. The Committee reported, <quote>Continuing to sanction task force operations as stand-alone law enforcement entities—with widespread authority to operate at will across multiple jurisdictional lines—should not continue. The current approach violates practically every sound principle of police oversight and accountability applicable to narcotics interdiction.</quote> The Texas legislature passed a law that ends the ability of a narcotics task force to operate as an entity with no clear accountability. The legislation transfers authority for multicounty drug task forces to the Department of Public Safety and channels one-quarter of asset forfeiture proceeds received by the task forces to a special fund to support drug abuse prevention programs, drug treatment, and other programs designed to reduce drug use in the county where the assets are seized.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HD98E9CCA6DD54EAEA416319577D0E5F3"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Texas’s <quote>corroboration</quote> law was passed thanks to a coalition of Christian conservatives and civil rights activists.

<paragraph id="HF1AF43B585834B278BDDB2B798B64620"><enum>(8)</enum><text>During floor debate, conservative Texas legislators pointed out that Mosaic law requires corroboration: <quote>One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.</quote> Deuteronomy 19:15. Jesus concurred with the corroboration rule: <quote>If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. . . . But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</quote> Matthew 18:15–16.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HF0FE5CEBE3D4454B8D9B839DBE0DC078"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Texas’s <quote>corroboration</quote> law had an immediate positive impact. Once prosecutors needed more than just the word of one person to convict someone of a drug offense they began scrutinizing law enforcement tactics. This new scrutiny led to the uncovering of massive corruption and civil rights abuse by the Dallas police force. In what became known nationally as the <quote>Sheetrock</quote> scandal, Dallas police officers and undercover informants were found to have set up dozens of innocent people, mostly Mexican immigrants, by planting fake drugs on them consisting of chalk-like material used in Sheetrock and other brands of wallboard. The revelations led to the dismissal of over 40 cases (although some of those arrested were already deported). In April 2005, a former Dallas narcotics detective was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the scheme. Charges against others are pending.</text> </paragraph>

<paragraph id="H2099C764B90C49AAA9BF2B15E4D6C447"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Mandatory minimum sentences are statutorily prescribed terms of imprisonment that automatically attach upon conviction of certain criminal conduct, usually pertaining to drug or firearm offenses. Absent very narrow criteria for relief, a sentencing judge is powerless to mandate a term of imprisonment below the mandatory minimum. Mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses rely solely upon the weight of the substance as a proxy for the degree of involvement of a defendant’s role.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H0ACB1F026BCD41FDAD8C8E9DF43A73A3"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and at the height of the public outcry over crack cocaine, Congress acted hastily, without sufficient hearings, and enacted hard line penalties that targeted low-level drug offenders. These penalties included new, long mandatory minimum sentences for such offenders.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HA46BBD2862F9409184248CB626DA67DD"><enum>(3)</enum><text>According to the Bureau of Prisons, in 1986, when the new drug law containing lengthy mandatory minimum sentences passed, the prison population was 46,055. Today, the Federal prison population is over 186,094 prisoners, up almost 300 percent in 31 years.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H0E88A77688BA427CA8DFEF1A660E1D71"><enum>(4)</enum><text>According to the Bureau of Prisons, the cost to keep one prisoner in Federal prison for one year is over $31,000.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H13435C578CA7401EAC026DA43E1FC3CF"><enum>(5)</enum><text>According to the Department of Justice, since the enactment of mandatory minimum sentencing for drug users, the Federal Bureau of Prisons budget increased from $876 million in 1987 to about $7.1 billion in 2017.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H886B95D73E854AFB80BCCCC423196EF5"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, between 1995 and 2010, over 400,000 drug offenders were sentenced under Federal law; of these, almost 250,000 (61 percent) received mandatory minimum sentences.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H0CEDA92C99F040A78E1246BB37EC2BB9"><enum>(7)</enum><text>According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, drug offenders released from prison in 1986 who had been sentenced before the adoption of mandatory sentences and sentencing guidelines had served an average of 22 months in prison. In 2010, almost two-thirds of all drug offenders received a mandatory sentence, with most receiving a 10-year minimum. Most of these offenders are nonviolent or lower-level offenders with little or no criminal history: in 2010, 51.6 percent had few or no prior convictions, 83.6 percent did not have weapons involved in their offense, and only 6 percent were considered leaders, managers, or supervisors of drug operations.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H0E7AEC9878CB4B34ACD9273B44B95DC1"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Mandatory minimum sentences have consistently been shown to have a disproportionate impact on African-Americans. The United States Sentencing Commission, in a 15-year overview of the Federal sentencing system, concluded that <quote>mandatory penalty statutes are used inconsistently</quote> and disproportionately affect African-American defendants. African-American drug defendants are 20 percent more likely to be sentenced to prison than White drug defendants.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HBE0C6FF6D4FB4248BFA0A84B1ABF1E82"><enum>(9)</enum><text>According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, between 1994 and 2003, the average time served by African-Americans for a drug offense increased by 62 percent, compared to a 17 percent increase among White drug defendants.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HCDBB8DE07CD641B0961A59E2CB80001B"><enum>(10)</enum><text>According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, government surveys document that drug use is roughly consistent across racial and ethnic groups. While there is less data available regarding drug sellers, research from the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the National Institute of Justice has found that drug users generally buy drugs from someone of their own racial or ethnic background. But, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, over 70 percent of all Federal narcotics offenders sentenced each year are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans, many of whom are low-level offenders.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H90E0F837FADA4F0683BDEF65E8A303E3"><enum>(11)</enum><text>As a result of Federal prosecutors’ focus on low-level drug offenders, the overwhelming majority of individuals subject to the heightened crack cocaine penalties are African-American. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s 2007 Report to Congress on crack cocaine, only 8.8 percent of Federal crack cocaine convictions were imposed on White Americans, while 81.8 percent and 8.4 percent were imposed on African-Americans and Hispanics, respectively.</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="H412081B2B6CD4F42AE06407B37D9692B"><enum>(12)</enum><text>According to the U.S. Census, African-Americans comprise 12 percent of the U.S. population and, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, about 10 percent of all drug users, but almost 30 percent of all Federal drug convictions according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.</text> </paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HEBF8EFCF5F9148C6BCF56101D5699B82"><enum>(13)</enum><text>According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, African-Americans, on average, now serve almost as much time in Federal prison for a drug offense (58.7 months) as Whites do for a violent offense (61.7 months).</text> </paragraph> <paragraph id="HBAF200D613B04E94B0F0157B790056EA"><enum>(14)</enum><text>According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in 2010, almost 30 percent of women entering Federal prison did so for a drug offense. Linking drug quantity with punishment severity has had a particularly profound impact on women, who are more likely to play peripheral roles in a drug enterprise than men. However, because prosecutors can attach drug quantities to an individual regardless of the level of a defendant’s participation in the charged offense, women have been exposed to increasingly punitive sentences to incarceration.</text> </paragraph>
